15,The Work,DoneDigging,"If any of these three did Ayahuasca, especially Kim Jong Un, it would likely be a hellish experience beyond what most could imagine. I can only imagine how deep seated his issues are. I hear that the people who struggle the most are the ones who try to control everything, which is why dictators would suffer greatly, but ultimately it would help them learn the errors of their ways, if they were willing... Which is highly unlikely. ",0,2,eflpk3c,t3_aat9x5,t1_ecuwqwk,/r/Ayahuasca/comments/aat9x5/the_work/eflpk3c/,0.117,0.84,0.043,-0.6187
