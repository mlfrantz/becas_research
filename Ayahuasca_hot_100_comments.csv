> Miller&#039;s analysis of a scraping from the fox snout pouch and a plant sample found in the ritual bundle - via liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry - turned up trace amounts of bufotenine, DMT, harmine, cocaine and benzoylecgonine.

> The plants found in the bundle do not grow at those altitudes, suggesting the bundle&#039;s owner may have been a traveling shaman or another expert in the rituals of psychotropic plant use, or someone who was part of an extensive medicinal plant trading network.

> Miller joined the Cueva del Chileno excavation project when archaeologists Juan Albarrac&iacute;n-Jord&aacute;n of the Universidad Mayor de San Andr&eacute;s in Bolivia and Jos&eacute; Capriles of Pennsylvania State University sought her expertise to identify the plant matter they had found in the bundle.

143,I was hospitalized after an intense bad trip (psychotic episode),Orion818,"Thank you for sharing your story, it's important for people to read these kind of experiences. Ayahuasca can help people in miraculous way but it can also cause damage just the same. I wish you well in your healing process and that it won't keep you away from other forms of psychospititual work. Sometimes to full heal you need to go back into that space, just in more gentle and cautious manners. 

I'm of the perspective that there needs to be more emphasis on integration post ayahuasca as well as preparatory centering and grounding work before ceremonies. The idea that a lot of providers can assess somebody over the phone in one conversation, have them drink the medicine coming directly from their hectic everyday lifestyle, then return back to the modern world just as fast as they came seems irresponsible to me. The majority of people come out just fine but I think situations like yours are a bit too common and could possibly be avoided or in the least be less damaging.

I suppose this is just a part of the growing pains of bringing this medicine into the modern world, I don't have any direct answer nor do I condemn people for their approaches but it's something that really needs to be kept in the forefront of the discussion of this work.

Not blaming you at all, and maybe this wouldn’t have made a difference, but sometimes I wonder if people should stay away from ayahuasca until they are at least maybe 25 years old?

146,I was hospitalized after an intense bad trip (psychotic episode),Sigeraed,"The power of these substances is their ability to induce an altered state of consciousness. The issue being that experiencing these states can be a real challenge to the ego. The ego is a mirror, when well polished, your experience can be blissful but it can also be really challenging when the ego resists. 

I think that when experiencing the true nature of reality, the ego recoils, you experience a dark night of the soul. However you can experience it in multiple ways, either a very dark dark view of the world, which can last years, create anxiety, depression, psychosis or you can experience bliss.

I really liked this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXOfRwChGDw&feature=youtu.be&t=1546) I recommended last week to someone who had a dark experience. 

As others have pointed out, integration is key. I hope you are safe now, don't blame yourself but also hope that this experience was created by your ego, because of its fear of non existence, of not being real. 

The reality is in between, the path of the middle, we both exist and not exist at the same time. Advaita Vedanta, the non duality.

Loss of ego and emotions floating around...life became a merry go round with me on the outside looking in and every moment in time it was stuck on the same scene...NOTHING made sense...
Woke up in an ambulance after suffering from a grand mal seizure from consuming an incomprehensible amount of water...because drinking water was the ONLY thing that provided only the briefest and slightest reprieve from a living hell. If only I just drank beer! 

For months every moment was a borderline panic and internal existential battle of meaning and a continuous losing of self...slipping away into the cracks of a dark and demented underbelly if existence...beautiful flowers on glorious sunny days were gross and tricking me....a strong wind could well up and blow me to dust into infinity...my soul was rotting...the battle was moment to moment day to day

I was fortunate to see a poster for a zen retreat at which later that week I was blessed to connect with a zen Buddhist monk and zen center. He met with me for a few hours...Within maybe 60 seconds of drinking his herbal tea specific to me and my situation I felt a calm and connection to pre-incident me and for the first time since had hope. Many doses of tea and a commitment to Sun-Do breathing practice and zen meditation I was able to reconstruct a self that was peaceful, happy and grounded. From that first tea, it was still a long journey where I had to work daily so close to myself it was almost too much...I had to have faith and trust in the process. 

Thank you for sharing and I’m so happy you have found yourself again and have solid ground to keep on with your personal and spiritual development.

151,I was hospitalized after an intense bad trip (psychotic episode),hoshhsiao,"It sounds like you did a lot of things right. 

It also sounds to me that this experience provoked an existential crisis that challenged you into intensive study of just what is real, and about death. (I kinda wonder what your astrology charts says about your past lives). 

You have read the Dalai Lama, so I presume you got the whole philosophy of impermanence. 

Adyashanti has a great talk about the three levels of awakenings: the awakening of the Mind, the Heart, and the Guts. 

Awakening of the Mind is _realizing_ an identification with the I AM.  So not just an intellectual understanding. Something in you shifts and go “Oh!”

Awakening of the Heart is the realization of Wholeness. That no part can be separated. That you literally see the Whole, all at once, seamlessly. 

Awakening of the Guts is the body awakening ... some really deep ingrain fears of no longer existing, and of dying. It is the awakening of No Self. 

(It is interesting you got than koan about “why do people have eyes?” When I read that, I got a whole stream about perspective, Subject, View). 

Adyashanti is a really interesting teacher because his talks are very clear and he teaches by transmission. Who he is embodies the teachings he is conveying, so it is easier for your consciousness to realize what he is saying. If this interests you, I can go try to find the specific talk he did about this.

faz cinco dias da minha cerimonia e eu me identifiquei com literalmente CADA coisa que você disse. sem exceção alguma. eu realmente não fazia ideia das reais consequências da Ayahuasca, do trabalho IMENSO de integrar tudo isso. me sinto no controle e ao mesmo tempo sem controle, como se a qualquer momento eu pudesse desabar e entrar num surto psicótico. 

eu também não tenho histórico nenhum na família e achei que ficaria tudo bem. a minha experiência durante a cerimônia foi muito positiva, mas o baque veio depois. caralho, que baque. de se perguntar o porquê de tudo. marquei psicólogo pra quinta e é a única coisa que consigo pensar. também acabei indo pro hospital, num ataque de ansiedade, mas passou. é um sentimento que vai e vem. as vezes parece estar tudo sob controle e as vezes bate o desespero. meus pais não sabem, e a menina “colega” que me levou à cerimônia já não me responde faz uns 3 dias. mandei um áudio no Whats dela perguntando se era normal se sentir estranho depois. 

saber que isso aconteceu com vc me deixa muito triste, por saber que vc sofreu e por me ver muito na mesma situação. eu espero que a gente se recupere de tudo, realmente espero! não sei se vou precisar de internação eventualmente, ou de contar pros meus pais sobre o que aconteceu, mas realmente está tudo muito complicado. Ayahuasca realmente não é pra todo mundo. mas saiba que não estamos sozinhas e que, no final, todos voltamos para o mesmo lugar. que tudo faz sentido e que estamos em casa. eu vim no Reddit procurando alguém pra me garantir que esse sentimento iria passar, e seu relato me deixou menos otimista hahahah mas acontece. se eu pudesse voltar no passado, com certeza não teria tomado. lógico que aquilo que sentimos é inexplicável e muito bonito, algo perto de Deus e da origem de tudo. mas as vezes acho que certas portas tem que permanecer fechadas. e que não precisamos abri-las. já somos sagrados e já estamos com Deus, nada além é necessário. mas saiba, de novo, que a gente tá junto nessa!

160,I was hospitalized after an intense bad trip (psychotic episode),SkitsG,"Thanks for sharing. I also went through something similar, my first encounter with Ayahuasca was horrific and all I could feel was panic of death. It shook me pretty bad and had visions and nightmares after the ceremony.   


I still went through a few more ceremonies because I couldn't let fear take over me but never worked for me, Ayahuasca didn't seem to show me any visuals or anything though on one ceremony I thought I was poisoned and was finally coming to an end. It was a horrible feeling of me not wanting to drink Ayahuasca ever again, all I could remember was me talking to it that I have a lot of respect for it and I didn't want to die that night. After that I was like - why didn't I just let go and see where that could have taken me.

&#x200B;

So after a year or so I was invited to do Ayahuasca during the day time, as I felt bit scared to do it at night. I still had some feelings of fear and such towards Ayahuasca but me being stubborn I went ahead and accepted the invitation.

&#x200B;

This time Ayahuasca wasn't as strong, I felt I had ""somewhat' control over it, but it did show me some things that I thought I couldn't handle, I wasn't prepared to know that. It showed me how time didn't exist, that I was just one... one consciousness, how all is just connected to one thing. There is no beginning, there is no end. Life just is, everything is just is... not sure how else to explain it, I was just infinite, I was nothing and was all.

&#x200B;

After that nothing made sense, two quite strong experiences with Ayahuasca I'd say. At times I'd question life, questioned everything, people didn't seem to be the same I felt like I was on a higher conscious level, like more spiritually aware than others around me.  


Watching Youtube videos to try to understand more, but I don't think that helped much as it would just make me remember what I had gone through. I'd wake up and feel so tired from all the thinking throughout my days, sometimes in my sleep I had dreams of being on Ayahuasca again... so weird.  


I just wasn't aware of these terms - **existential crisis,** **psychotic** and **depersonalization.** I just thought it was just work that had to be done after the ceremonies, so I didn't pay too much attention to all the feelings I was going through, all the panicking, being scared of the night etc... At that time I thought I should have taken the blue pill, the red pill wasn't for me.

&#x200B;

After a few months I read somewhere that I had opened a new way of looking at things and the only way to go ""back to normal"" was to do all the oposite before getting into the Ayahuasca ways. Watching tv, alcohol, sex... etc - I feel like I am in my normal state now and just recently watched Phamacopeia from Hamilton and kind of got me thinking into going back to my ways with Ayahuasca lol  


Death comes to us all, I can only enjoy my time here for now to the fullest extend. I guess what I am saying is you can treat Ayahuasca for what it is .... a drug or the truth of it all. That one day we will all be part of that world or it was just a night you got so fked up that's it.

I have not had such a devastating experience as you, but the last time I did Ayahuasca I felt like I touched upon what a psychosis would be like. I remember grabbing the wall repetitively trying to get hold of reality again. 
Luckily I did return to normal, but it didn't leave me in bliss like previous experiences - (had done Aya 5 times before that). I haven't done Ayahuasca since, because I suddenly felt how fragile the construct of my mind really is - and Ayahuasca is definitely something that could shatter it to bits. Reading your post confirms this feeling for me.

Aya had been profoundly helpful for me the first 5 times, to break twisted stuff that needed fixing. And still I would say that this last scary experience has tought me profound and powerful lessons. But I also realize that this same progress I could have accomplished through meditation - a practice I have since picked up. It requires more effort, but it is also far less risky; and the best thing is, it moves at the same speed that I am able to integrate. 

Ayahuasca is like using a powertool to fix the most fragile instrument. Better to use simple manual tools, and some careful effort and patience. 
Its easy to miss how fragile the mind is, untill you have experienced it shaking on its foundations.",1,1,ejyq4og,t3_b8b9o4,t3_b8b9o4,/r/Ayahuasca/comments/b8b9o4/i_was_hospitalized_after_an_intense_bad_trip/ejyq4og/

After using and learning so much about ayahuasca for the past four years, to me the biggest failure and missed opportunity of the whole “scene” is the failure to support and integrate afterwards. The fact that ayahuasca is illegal in most places drives it underground or requires ppl to travel and not have local resources post-ceremony.

I don’t think this will ever get better until ayahuasca is medically and legally accepted so trained therapists will be able to work with people. Until then it’s like Russian roulette albeit the odds are much better.

I’ll also suggest that for people with mental health issues the alternative of typical pharmaceutical drugs might not be much better, so for many desperate ppl ayahuasca might be a calculated risk with better odds than big pharma.

I've always taken acid from the same dealer, it's liquid substance inside a sugar cube. I've used it many times. Half of it was fun and ligh. One led to hallucinations and deep thinking.

I used ayahuasca for the second time in the middle of 2017. December 2017 I had the 4g shrooms experience. March 2018 was my third and final ayahuasca experience.

I've always been an agnostic and that didn't change. Curiously enough, the only thing that made sense to me was existentialism itself. I distanced myself from nihilism because it felt too pessimistic. I like the idea that while there's no reason for existing and probably no higher power we can still, as humans existing in a society, find our own subjective meaning for life. I think that if this life is the one only one I'll ever get, I might as well enjoy it. It set me free to realize that every mistake and humiliation I've ever suffered won't matter in the end. The only thing I can do is try to feel good and perhaps make other people feel good as well.

216,I was hospitalized after an intense bad trip (psychotic episode),Orion818,"My symptoms were pretty text book for DP/DR, I'll list them out.

- Constant brain fog and cognitive issues, trouble holding focus, difficulty holding train of thought.

- Digestion and sleep problems.

- My body felt numb and distant, co-ordination issues, spatial awareness problems. Dizziness and vertigo.

- I felt very dull emotionally except for fear, lots of fear and sense of seperation/abandoment, like that purgatory state you can go to on psychedelics journeys but constant. My sense of self was shatter

- Visual snow and lack of abiltiy to focus on objects correctly. Tinnitus and extreme sensitivity to sound and light

- Total loss of drive and identitiy. Feeling dettached and like an observer to everything around me

- Feelings of loss of definition of reality, like everything was a dream and could fall apart at any moment.

- Strong suicidal ideation and intrusive thoughts.

As far as healing the DP/DR it's kind of complicated and hard to write about in a linear fashion but I will do my best.

It started out with accupuncture and chinese medicine. These modalities definitely helped in the short term with some of the symptoms, they helped me feel more grounded and also helped with some of the sleep issues I was having. I wasn't able to afford more then ten sessions though so while it was beneficial the symptoms returned over time. If I was able to afford constant treatment I feel it would have continued to help and would have sped up my recovery. I also feel that if I was practicing something like qi gong at the time this modality would have been a great tool to get the ball rolling.

Next was cranial sacral therapy, this helped a lot. When the soul/ego is in such a state of dettachment it often needs a gentle approach for it to feel safe in re-entering the body. When I was on the table I would experience intense tension and shaking, deep trance states with visuals, all sorts of large and small shifts. I did ten sessions as well and I feel the work was permanent, it helped me initiate the healing process and week after week I could feel the difference. I feel the practitioner really matters with this therapy, they need to be grounded, centered, and most importantly neutral energetically. I was very lucky to find someone who was quire connected and experienced with multidimensional healing and she was a great ally in my process.

After that things are a bit of a blur, I had made some progress but was still very lost. Sometimes weeks felt like months, other times months felt like weeks. The dream world often overlapped my waking conciouness and I still had very little sense of reality or grounding.

Fortunately I had experience with meditation, a practice similar to zen tradition but with some more transcendental focus, I used this practice daily as it was the only thing that felt real at the time. I would meditate everyday for an hour at least and at times would do laying meditations for upwards of 3 hours. This was something that I felt I needed to do despite it seeming like not the best thing to over engage in.

In my meditations I found a center in the dark void that my consciousness resided in. Despite at times making my sense of disreality worse the opening of my higher consciousness and awareness seemed to help. It connected me to something that felt real. I would have glimpses of a higher purpose to my state of disconnection and I felt like my way to heal was not to avoid the darkness but to go deeper. Looking back I should have been balancing this practice with more grounding work though, there were periods where I floated in that meditative void for months on end. Perhaps it was where I needed to be though.

My life was basically this meditation practice and silent walking for a couple years. I would walk everyday to ground myself and connect to my body, ideally in nature as much as possible. This practice of meditating, then grounding and integrating though silent mindful walking slowly crept me forward inch by inch as my higher consciousness started to merge with my body. It was a painfully slow process but month by months I felt less fear and disconnection despite my energetic awareness increasing.

Like I said above the way for me to heal was not to push that energy aside but to invite it into myself. Fortunately I had many insights early on in my journey before the depersonalization as well as during my recovery that allowed me to realize that there was no returning back to ego for me, it wasn't real and would only lead to more suffering. My psyche and personal identification had been shattered and it wasn't going to get fixed by re-building the story and my egoic mechanisms again. I knew that centered consciousness, not the mind, was our true state and that I had to stay courageous and keep moving forward in my practice. There were times where this was extremely clear and obvious but this assurance would come and go. I would often doubt myself and fall back into old patterns and disassociation then re-connect, each time a little bit more integrated, two steps forward one step back( or 2 steps forward and 3 steps backwards at times.) Sometime the dark periods would last for months, it was a very challenging time.

Overall I was making good gains with this practice of meditating and walking, slowly coming together but still not really functionally in the world well. I was also doing body scans a lot during this time, especially the heart and the solar plexus. I would often do this laying down for hours when I was feeling particular floaty or just throughout the day, connecting to the subtle sensations and tuning into whatever was stirring around at the time. There was still obviously something missing though. I felt like my energetic boundaries were super thin, like I had no drive and no purpose, like a lost soul despite feeling better then I had. I felt transparent and vapid, empty like a ghost.

Through a series of synchronicities I then wound up being led to Iboga and things really started to progress. I took a flood dose with a reputable center and it shifted me on a really deep level. It help me connect to what I can define as my ""masculine"" energy. I became more decisive and embodied though this medicine. It helped establish a connection to my personal boundaries, my drive, and my inner strength and focus. There are were many stages of integration but the main thing I gained was a stronger clarity and ability to see my current situation from a more objective view. It helped me see the traps and blockages in my awareness and the steps I needed to take from that point. I also did a second flood 9 months later to continue with the work.

I did a write up here at the ibogaine subreddit outlining my experience. I slowly but surely started to build myself through these teaching. I continued with my daily meditation and grounding work and started to incorporate more and more integrative habits to help ground my energy and aid in working through my densities. If you read that post you can see what I did. The process involved diet shifts, sleep hygiene, exercise, daily routine, and other things to ground me in reality and engage in the present. More importantly it helped me do these things despite the fear I had deep within me that had been holding me back. It gave me an anchor of sorts that I could find in the existential void I was was living in. Before the Iboga I would fall back into disassociation when the symptoms got too overwhelming but it helped me to connect to an inner strength and clarity to see beyond my current state rather then collapse from it. Despite feeling weak and dizzy or fearful and alone I would tune into that strength and get out of bed and move on with my practice.

Day by day, week by week, I built myself up. Again, two steps forward one step back. There were many points of darkness still, feelings of deep fear, loneliness. Except now I was able to sit with these feelings and sensations, I didn't run away from them or react harshly, I just let them be as I continued on with my meditations and my increasingly dedicated grounding and stability practice that I wrote about in the link above. Slowly my symptoms started to minimize as I connected to my genuine intrinsic self. My higher energetic centers began to merge with the lower ones I started to feel more whole. I still felt expanded but now the energies were starting to root into my solar plexus and core identification centers. My energetic bodies began to align with the physical.

It was a non linear experience so it's very hard to explain but through constant reflections, synchronicities, and day to day practice this genuine identity just sort of emerged on its own. I had to confront a lot of inner darkness and received a lot of painful reflections but my inner guidance would always direct me the right way. There was also a lot of work done in those Iboga floods that I'm not capable of understanding, there were connections made during those two weekends that had profound effects.

What I learned from this is that DP/DR from psychedelics occurs when the persons programming gets too challenged by the intensity of the egoically destructive nature of the medicines. The purpose of this work is to slowly dissolve the mind centered identity and to come into heart center, to become manifested as our truthful state as embodiment of universal consciousness. When too much happens too fast the mind hits an ""off"" switch of sorts, the fear of ego death becomes too strong so it locks up the nervous system and goes into a protection mode of sorts. I imagine it's what shamans call soul loss. The centered and embodied energy literally leaves the lower energetic centers.

Another aspect is when you hit a wall of trauma during the expansion process. I myself have a history of trauma from a young age, around age 8 or so I experienced very deep shielding and loss of vital energies. I disconnected from spirit and formed a mask to get me through life, a totally false identity to protect myself. Underneath that mask was very deep fear, loathing, sadness, pain, anger etc. This protective egoic identity had been with me for so long that I genuinely didn't know who I was, I smiled at people and everyone though I was fine but it was mostly all a lie, underneath it my true self was in immense pain. Since it was at such a young age I had no idea this had even happened. I built up my whole life with this identity, all my relationships, my career, the way I spoke, everything was built on top of that trauma. Looking back it was super obvious that I wasn't ok and was living in extreme repression but I had no idea. This false identity had become so deeply entrenched that it was a part of me on every level, mental, physical, emotional etc.

So, I feel what happens with people like me is that when the medicines start to dissolve the mind into the universal consciousness there is nothing to hold on to. When your core identity is so deeply disconnected and fragmented there is nothing to bond you to this reality once your definitions start to fade. A lot of people experience a period of darkness or a purgatory like state in their work but with people who are so fundamentally broken they don't return because there is nothing to return to. They try to go back to their egoic mechanism but it has been fragmented too much by the medicine and if their soul connection hasn't been properly established they get left in limbo, unintegrated and left floating untethered in a sea of conciousness. It's not just people with traumatic backgrounds who experience this, people who are deeply stuck in their egos can experience the same thing, but I feel those with underlying issues like the ones mentioned are more at risk.

I could type about this for hours so I might leave it at the but in summary I healed through cranical sacral therapy, daily meditation (one hour in the morning), Iboga, diet, exercise, and incorporating a centering/grounding lifestyle ( the fulll description is in that Iboga write up). All of these things allowed the healing energy of spirit/nature to slowly shift my energy and consciousness over many years of consistent practice and dedication. I weeded out the negative energetics in my life, continually introduced positive ones, and gave myself lots of space for my intuition to guide me and dove into my fears instead of running away from them.

The biggest thing to take away for me was that to heal DP/DR you can't run away from it. I suppose some people will see this differently but for me personally once those gates to the universal energy were opened it wasn't an option to close them, I had seen too much and I couldn't trick my soul into going back to the way I was. When I say I healed myself I don't mean I'm the same person I was before the de-realization or that I'm back to ""normal"". I've changed to a very different person through this process. For someone like me who had experienced such an intense opening trying to return back to the safety of my mind and social programming would have just left me incomplete and fragmented again, there was no turning back.

I should say though that I went about this process in a pretty intense way, I was truly walking the razors edge at some points. For other people they may want to approach their healing more gently but I think the underlying approach would be the same.",1,3,ek1pf49,t3_b8b9o4,t1_ejzxczn,/r/Ayahuasca/comments/b8b9o4/i_was_hospitalized_after_an_intense_bad_trip/ek1pf49/
218,I was hospitalized after an intense bad trip (psychotic episode),thorgal256,"Fair enough, there is always an unpredictable risk and unfortunately you ended up having one of the worse experience one could think of. I love ayahuasca and it disturbs me and saddens me that there is always a possibility to go through the same thing. You are saying you met other people who had traumatic experiences and i know there are plenty. I just wish there would be more statistical data about the proportion of users who end up facing severe problems. People who only had blissful experiences or challenging experiences that they could overcome and later see it as a benefit tend to blame those who had these traumatic experiences and downplay the risks. On the other hand, those who had traumatic experiences will only or mostly talk about that, which is understandable and make it sound like the proportion of users who had the same is much higher.

I've had a back and knee injury that's been effecting my mobility for about a year now and am on disability. In the last couple months I've been making a ton of progress and it's looking like I will be able to start working in a month or two. Mentally/emotionally I've been feeling solid for probably a year and a half now but things have gotten in the way. 

As far a enjoying life, yeah, I would say I am. I wouldn't say I'm living in total joy or anything yet, there is a lot with my living situation and my body that make things a grind. There is also some underlying emotional/connective energy I feel I need to work through that I feel is holding me back in regards to relationships/creativity, stuff like that. Overall though I feel positive, directed, and embodied. I no longer experience any sense of fear or disconnection, no more existential pain or emotional issues. I wake up, go for walks, do my physio, meditate etc. Every day I look forward to progressing and the future looks good, there are very few down periods now and when they happen it's for maybe half a day at most.

Edit: And how long did it take? The worst of it lasted a couple years or so. I was just sitting in that void and not making much progress. When I really started to make break throughs maybe 2 years to get a handle on it? It took another year or so to really start feeling embodied and whole again.

I think ICEERS is pro-ayahuasca, but with caveats and they are not naive to the risks.

An ICEERS official did an AMA here a couple of weeks ago and look at his writing here on the risks. A very thoughtful response, I thought.

> Ayahuasca is a psychedelic tea derived from the ayahuasca vine, Banisteriopsis caapi, and the Psychotria viridis plant, both of which are native to the Amazon.

> In recent years, ayahuasca has piqued the interest and curiosity of people in the rest of the world, culminating in an ayahuasca tourism industry throughout Amazonian regions of Central America.

> Brazilian prisons started to offer ayahuasca through the prisoners&#039; rights advocacy group Acuda, based in in Porto Velho.

295,My core shaking experience.,snefferu,"Thank you for sharing your experience, I could tell how hard it was for you to put some of it into words.

I’m currently integrating healing from anorexia, it took around six months after ceremony for it to become apparent but I’d been weight restored for around 10 years and had convinced myself that I was recovered, when actually only the physical weight had been recovered and the underlying roots were still the same. I actually relapsed after I came back from Peru but that’s what it took to show me I couldn’t just maintain the surface any more without fixing the roots.

Since doing this (it’s ongoing work, I’m by no means fully recovered) I’ve noticed that I get more frequent and severe panic attacks, mood swings and moments of confusion. I’m starting to realize that caloric restriction had been a coping mechanism I’d been using all my life, and without the desensitizing effect of this self medication the experience of my own feelings can be overwhelming. I’m also learning that my illness was likely triggered by something that happened during early childhood that I’d never addressed, and this is something I think I need to fully move past in order to make a full recovery.

I too had a difficult ceremony in which I was unable to communicate how much trouble I was in, although what happened to my physical body while I was out was the opposite to yours (I was told it looked like i had passed out, I had to be picked up and carried to the shaman).

What you went through was traumatic and there’s a lot to process. I think aftercare is very important. Do you feel like you have enough support?

296,My core shaking experience.,Julyan23,"That is a quite power full experience you had the first time. It might have been the fasting accelerating it, personally I don't recommend fasting just have a meal 6-7 hours before ceremony. Fasting can potentially make you too sensitive or shutdown your digestive system make you have no effect at all. There is a state in ""Limbo"" or ""Carnivale"" in which the mind is bombarded with vision too many to make sense, yet the mind is trying to grasp trying to give meaning. Often for something to be released it has to come into conscious first. Not everything has meaning sometimes things simply are as they are and simply being  present without judgment and labeling but simply as observer will allow you to release what no longer serves you.

The good news is tougher experiences are generally the most rewarding. Something in us want to remain in the comfort zone and change is often met with resistance. when something gets released that was part of you for a long time there might occur a feeling of discomfort and unease until you have adapted to your new ""self"". so give it time just try to be in the moment.

I'm surprised the shaman gave a full cup, even tho that doesn't say much about its potency and amount. the various shamans i drank with in Peru always gave a smaller dose on first ceremony and if its not enough its always easier to drink more.

Reminding me of how intense and painful it was. The Ayahuasca took me back through all the pain in my life I had suppressed. The day after (2nd ceremony) it went on.. and I know for sure that if I would ever attend another ceremony it would just go further where I left: pain, fear... all suppressed before, but now freely and unstoppable through me. After the first half of the ceremony it was going through pure darkness, after that it felt like the sun rose again and I was just dancing and hugging people around in pure bliss. I wish I had words to describe what happened, you write very well.

Your experience sounds very intense. I am glad you had the right people around you making it a safe experience. And I am also happy it helped you in your life. She helped me too even though it was brutal at moments.

How long ago was this?

I had a very powerful experience. It was my birthday, a full moon and I had been cleansing for 3 weeks. Cleansing and fasting seems to make a huge difference.

It sounds like you were the first clear channel for the medicine and the energy didn’t get transferred until you called for help. Absolutely amazing.

The Picasso painting... just curious, I had a vision once of people that looked yes, like a painting or Roman times or Picasso era or something... they were potentially contorting but the world “tumbling” and gymnastics keeps coming to mind. Not athletic, but more so interlinked... hard to describe but this reminded me of what you were saying.

In my big experience I thought I would never go back to the medicine.. why? What would be the purpose? I had seen it all... it was also quite traumatizing at the time. I didn’t know how I would function in life anymore.

I had a friend who also said he died 1000 deaths. At first he said he was really frightened, anxious and thought he was stuck in the loop. Would come to and then die again... and again and again. Eventually he said he was just able to watch the whole process unattached.

Before you even mentioned having an ED I figured you did based on what you wrote (also in ED recovery here) and wow... don’t feel any type of way about that. That was a BEAUTIFUL share.

321,An atheist experiences God,cottonpicker2,"Folks
thanks for reading my post and giving comments. Let me address some of those comments in this post instead of responding it individually for easy reading.

1) I used the word God as a catch all word, what I really mean by is the omniscient, omnipresent, all loving being/thing/super consciousness that transcends time & space.
2) I used the word atheist loosely to identify myself; I was a seeker of truth and couldn't accept all the current wisdom in all shapes and forms. I wasn't happy with what I know, and didn't know and sought the ultimate truth. 
3) Zhipa mentioned about ""Ra"". I had the revelation too that this Earth was visited by many messengers several times in the past to send the message of God. 
4) Also immediately after Ayahuasca experience, my first urge was to drop everything, quit family life and run person to person to spread the message of God. There was this strong urge to proselytize. I can perfectly understand how some of them went on to establish religions. I put an end to this thought after coming to my senses that Earth has plenty of religions and messengers to know about God.
5) Regarding my comment about ""delusion.."", you need to understand my background better. The country I grew was full of godmen/godwoman, 99.9% bogus, .1% maybe good that lie, cheat, and make people part with their money. I had a strong skepticism on anything related to God & religion. God was a business.

326,An atheist experiences God,obviousoctopus,"Beautifully said. Consider a few things:

Are all religions the same if we notice which ones ask to pray to something *separate* from yourself and which ones invite you to see deities *as yourself* or invite them to manifest *through yourself*.

Is it possible that some ""religions"" intentionally lead your attention outside and prayers in a direction where they cannot be useful?

Regarding pain and suffering, my experience is that they push me into presence, into remembering myself, as the deepening of myself moves the pain and suffering to the surface. As I remember myself more and more, it brings me to what I am.

332,An atheist experiences God,GSF1212,"There's nothing like direct experience! I might swap out number 6 for gratitude practice. Being grateful and dedicated rather than in constant suffering. Maybe it means that separation from source is painful? And so it brings one back to the source, what is called God. But it's not necessary and many systems of beliefs manipulate this to create a victim or martyr complex. Seems better to return to God through love rather suffering. Just my two cents.

338,An atheist experiences God,Rocky87109,"""I believe in ""ambiguous word""."" 

You can believe in whatever you want, but I find it hard you actually cared about the values of science in the first place.  While subjective experience is important, a true scientist would consider their intuition and subjective feelings while simultaneously being skeptical of them.  

I've had psychedelic experiences that ""reveal"" truly horrifying notions and as someone that values science and evidence I take it with a grain of salt.  


EDIT:  The fact that you think you would have said:

""You are delusional & stupid. I wont accept a word of what you are saying. There is absolutely no proof in anything that you’ve said"" 

Makes me think you weren't a very mature atheist or worse you are lying about your past.  I won't judge though as I believe in evidence, not just what I'm currently feeling to be the indicator of truth.  We all go through a process of understand what life is about though.  

And there are many religions that would scoff at you for saying you and everyone else is god.

Sorry for the direct questions, I'm just curious given your background as an Atheist. My view is that truly awakened ones do not think in these terms of greater beings and also accept that they don't know everything they only know themselves. Higher consciousness can exist without comparing it to God. ""Ra"" and many other Gods of different religions are simply a cultural representation of the sun and its relationship to our lives on Earth, it makes little sense to me that it would be linked to consciousness in any meaningful way.

343,An atheist experiences God,cottonpicker2,"I went to Amazon to read about reviews on the Law of one book. I came across an interesting comment by Nathan Parsons that is pasted here;

https://www.amazon.com/Ra-Material-Ancient-Astronaut-Speaks/dp/089865260X
==============================
For the first 25 years of my life, I was a hardcore atheist that hated all religion and didn't know that spirituality existed outside of it. These books completely changed that.

I'm a very intellectual person, so I immediately saw all the logical fallacies in most religions and didn't believe them because of it. I just assumed it was all wishful thinking. I remember the moment I realized I didn't believe in god... I was 5 or 6 years old and caught my mother pretending to be the tooth fairy. I realized that it was all made up and thought god must be as well. The same applied to the idea of extra-terrestrials / extra-dimensionals visiting us in the past/present... Why the heck wouldn't they just come out and communicate with us if they were visiting us? To be honest, I never really gave it hardly any thought. I was just of the currently common mindset of scientifically minded atheists and assumed there was most likely plant / animal life on other planets hundreds of lightyears away at minimum and there certainly wasn't any self-aware life anywhere near us, otherwise we would be picking up radio signals from them.

Leading up to what I refer to as my 'awakening', I was extremely depressed and was pretty close to dying of it. I wasn't happy with my life at all and was deeply disturbed by all the pain and suffering I saw in the world. I started philosophically seeking to understand my existence. Why am I looking out of these two eyes? Why do I have this perspective? I was so depressed that I started a whimsical google search wondering if there was any scientific validity to the December 2012 phenomenon. I thought to myself ""maybe there will be a solar flare that will wipe us all out, then at least I won't have to die alone"".

It was at this point I stumbled on the Law of One books (the Ra Material). I wasn't searching for more than a few minutes. I thought to myself, ""what the hell is the crazy nonsense? Who actually believes they could telepathically talk to aliens?"" I noticed it was an actual transcript of the dialog between a questioner and the supposed extra-dimensional being. I decided to read a bit of it so I could literally laugh at it and all the idiots who read it.

Once I started reading, it wasn't at all what I had expected. I was expecting gobbledygook but found it surprisingly logically coherent. My whole life, I had always tried to see the extremely large patterns of how society, civilization, the world, and the universe works. I would study one system (such as religion) and find glaring logical holes in it. I mostly believed the current atheist-scientific outlook but always found the scope to be a little too small. It just didn't account for everything. As I read the Law of One books, I pieced together a humongous gestalt puzzle that was larger than any viewpoint held by science or religion. Once most of the logical puzzle was put together in my mind, it explained much more than science or religion ever was able to with virtually no logical inconsistencies.

It took me months of digesting the material and warring with my old beliefs and ideals, but my new belief superseded my old beliefs and doubts. I couldn't ignore what I had learned. The biggest thing I had to get past was my atheism. But the whole thing only made sense if there was an omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent, infinite consciousness at the core of it all. After about 6 months of contemplation, I just told myself I had to accept it or abandon the whole concept. I couldn't just forget it because there was an unbelievable number of 'ah-ha!' moments throughout reading the material and it just explained too much of how life works.

I still don't necessarily believe that at the core of this Creation there is some anthropomorphous God with a white beard in white robes sitting on a cloud somewhere that judges anyone. In fact, what I believe that the Infinite Creator / Source has no experience of Itself without us. I believe there is a whole host of different entities / people at extremely different levels existence. What we experience here on Earth is just one specific type of experience, which includes a forgetting of Who and What we are.

The comedian Bill Hicks summed it up in a nutshell quite adeptly: ""Today, a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration. That we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. There is no such thing as death, life is only a dream and we're the imagination of ourselves"".

So to say these books were life-altering would be an understatement. I cannot recommend them enough.

348,An atheist experiences God,cottonpicker2,"This is a very interesting topic. one of my earlier reasons for being athest is the presence of pain and suffering in the world. the inequities, sorrow, whimsical nature of luck etc.

What many religions teach us is that the goal of human existence is to realize God (self actualization, enlightenment etc). You are destined to be born again and again until this happens. I've had this revelation that I was born many times in this world. The Buddhist/Hindu also teaches us this, not sure of other religions. 

How do you achieve realization when you never think of God? you would never think of God if you are too happy and enjoy the fruits of the world without any pain and suffering. this is the paradox. Every human being tries to avoid pain and suffering and maximize worldly pleasures. Maybe if you do good deeds you can achieve realization without the pain. Maybe the pain and suffering are a short cut to realization. 

during intense periods of pain and suffering, you question your human existence, the meaning and purpose of it all, and wonder why? this ultimately leads you to question the reality of the world (which is just pure illusion as per Hinduism) and in turn to realization.

349,An atheist experiences God,Jan_AFCNortherners,"I agree with your first and your last point. Your middle point however feels like an ad Hominem, as well as an “appeal to ridicule fallacy”. 

I, like you, have a hard time swallowing the dogma his point of view spouts liberally without any definition of his terms and it’s lack of nuance in general. To be candid, my issue is that instead of asking “what does this experience mean for me?” He leaps to the conclusion that “God is real for everyone”. I caution not to commit an attack on the person but his argument.

355,Anger,CivDis,"I had a ceremony a little like this, enough like this that it brought it all back.  Cool!

&#x200B;

The anger I was working on was with my Mom, who is now 92 and couldn't withstand its force.   Doesn't make my feelings any less intense, or lesson their need  be vented, I just needed a stand in.   I ended up going under fast, like 10 minutes, and then for about the next hour the \~225 lbs care-taker basically lay on top of 130 lbs me as  convulsed and tried to beat the crap out him.   I have no memories of this.   But like you, work up lighter.  It was almost like I could feel that the energetic charge of my body had been discharged??   When the rest of the participants told me what they saw, I couldn't believe it.  

&#x200B;

I still have lots of anger towards my Mom, but I can acknowledge and direct it now, where before it was like a nuke, just waiting.  The funniest thing, well to me anyway, is that my Mom is pretty raciest and the care-taker was a really kind gay man.   I doubt she will ever acknowledge her debt to her stand-in, but I like to think somehow that balanced things or cleared something or idk...  It seemed significant at the time.

Ayahuasca would be effective for pretty much any depression, but unfortunately there's no way to convey that fact. It's sad that there are so many people in that subreddit who are at the end of their rope, and the one post that might have actually helped them was rejected, but ultimately it's not my responsibility to help them. If they are meant to find their way to ayahuasca, it will find them, and I had forgotten that.

384,"/r/depression deleted my post about ayahuasca curing my depression, so I made something a little more up Reddit's alley.",ahamvritti,"Here was the original: ""I was very, very depressed for a long time. I tried therapy (which was laughable), pills, exercise and dietary changes, socializing in various forms, pretty much everything, and nothing worked. The world was just straight up a bleak, gray place, and it wasn't worth living in. As a last resort, figuring I had nothing to lose, I bought a one-way plane ticket to Peru to take part in a week of ayahuasca ceremonies, having heard that it is sometimes known to cure depression. If you haven't heard of it, ayahuasca is a psychedelic brew that contains DMT, which is pretty much the most powerful psychedelic there is. DMT is smokable, but I don't think you can get nearly as many of the therapeutic effects from a single 15 minute trip. The author of the above article does a pretty good job explaining what goes on, or at least as good as one can do given the utter intensity and alienness of the experience. It was by far the most terrifying experience of my life. Imagine cramming like 50 years of therapy into 5 nights, going down to the core of your being and being forced to confront and release all the emotions and negative thought habits you've been holding on to and repressing. Not only did it cure my depression, but also several physical ailments which I learned were physical manifestations of mental problems (eczema, heart palpitations, and digestive issues). If you are at the end of your rope (or even if you're not) I can't recommend it highly enough. But please don't make it yourself; the shamans were indispensable in terms of guidance and support, and it wouldn't have been the same without them. If you want more information just PM me, but a quick google search will land you some reputable organizations in the Iquitos area. Not only myself, but many of the other participants reported their depression cured as well. I know it seems crazy, but what do you have to lose? Life is actually bright and joyous now. I haven't felt this way since I was a little kid, and I thought my brain was broken, that I wasn't capable of ever feeling this way again. Depression is not what I thought it was, and it is beatable.
Edit: I've been made aware it's against the rules to encourage specific treatments, and I appreciate why that rule is in place. A medical professional generally has more knowledge and experience than an individual, which is why it's not a good idea to just pick your own medication or forgo treatment for something wacky. This certainly sounds wacky, but there's no way to tiptoe around my recommendation, and most medical professionals will never have even heard of ayahuasca. Hence my post.""

And yeah, I've become aware of that too. I'd spend way too much time on the computer (especially mindlessly browsing Reddit), not enough time exercising, and only destructive forms of socializing. I'm making a conscious effort to spend my time wisely now. So far so good - no desire to return to those habits.

That seems like a pretty wildly unfounded claim, no?  Psychedelic drugs ESPECIALLY effect everyone differently.  There's no doubt Ayahuasca will give you a different outlook on life, but beyond that... Its a bit much to say its going to cure anything.

Its been two months since my first Ayahuasca Ceremony, everyday since i have thought about it. In times of stress or anxiety i think back and it helps. 

I also have found it really frustrating to explain it to people who have asked me how it went. I dont want to be singled out or people to think im crazy. But at the same time i want to tell everyone about this experience and how it can help people because i know for myself how beautiful and beneficial it was. 

Alot has changed for me too as a person, it started before the ceremony and from what i read, feelings i had, a shift in my paradigm.
Aya galvanized these thoughts and feelings and my work with her is not finished, i have so much more to learn. We shall meet again, of that i am sure. 

I try to treat people how i would like to be treated. Animals, plants, insects, nature, i realise we are all emanations of the same source, connected. I enrolled on a course to train how to be a counselor/Therapist and ideally id like to go into pyschosynthesis as it recognizes and integrates the spiritual aspect of the human condition. Before i had done jobs i thought i should do from working on the roads to a security guard so this change in direction is a huge transformation in itself but i really feel a huge debt to make the most of my time here as a human being by helping others or atleast trying whilst im here.

I see myself going again in Fall 2018 or Summer 2019, not any sooner. Ecuador, Peru, or Brazil next time in the actual Amazon instead of the Andes. I'm interested in the nature and culture around the experience as much as the experience itself.

That's a good way to live. I try to live in harmony with Nature and be part of the cure, not the cancer. It's a challenge at times but I'm improving little by little.

I've been reading and learning a lot about world history, it was something this experience sparked in me. I've been perfecting how to make homemade veggie patties (got it down to a science now!), made some for a family get together on Sunday. I've been reading to my 2-year-old nephew and playing LEGOs with him, he thinks I am a Jedi (when he saw the trailer on tv, he said my name when a lightsaber came on the screen!). I've been talking candidly with my parents and my grandma about my travels, my journey, my plans...wasn't doing that before as well as I could have. 

I've caught up on some of my client work. Finishing up a new agency site with a diverse portfolio of clients as well. Mapping out new ideas to be service as well to the causes I mentioned in the write-up. Need to break everything down into bite-sized pieces or it won't get done.

Buddhism/Vedanta, science, and the concept of 'all my relations' from Native American mythos all overlap a lot. I would recommend reading the Dhammapada, the Upanishads, the Gita. Also, Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse (a way to make sense of all the wisdom in a personal way, only 120 pages but my favorite book of all-time). Watch 'Cosmos' by Carl Sagan and if you want, the newer version. Another good book/documentary to check out is 'Guns, Germs, Steel'. And if for historical context: 1491: America Before Colombus, there is also a documentary you can easily find on YouTube as well.

I'm on a path of renunciation, always shedding 'baggage' from the past (desires, expectations, possessions, obsessions, resentments, etc). Ayahuasca may be helpful to me at another point in my life but for now I am content with the powerful and pure experience I had. If I do it again, it will be in 2019 in either Ecuador, Peru, or Brazil (not sure yet if I'll do it at the beginning of my trip or at the end).

Crystals are a very complicated thing, and nucleation rates are one of the hardest to quantify properties of any system, but there are general things that will get you to this level quite easily (making a single boule is the ultimate goal, and something I’m not sure has been done at this scale).

The trick is to control the primary and secondary nucleation rates. Primary nucleation is when new crystals form, and requires a greater degree of supersaturation than secondary, but is necessary to create an initial crystal. Secondary nucleation is when crystals grow as DMT in solution adsorb onto the surface and join the crystal lattice.

Because secondary nucleation is more favourable than primary you can take a barely supersaturated metastable solution and add a seed crystal (a crystal you’d previously made as a result of primary nucleation) to ensure no further crystals form and just the one grows. You then need to maintain this small degree of supersaturation either by cooling the solution or evaporating your solvent, ensuring that it’s not to high resulting in more primary nucleation or if you’ve gone way too far crash crystallisation (which will form an opaque coral like structure).

Do all that right and the crystal will just keep growing and growing",1,6,ell6k9k,t3_bghygq,t1_ell4wy4,/r/Ayahuasca/comments/bghygq/if_you_want_a_beautiful_trip_why_not_start_with_a/ell6k9k/

459,If you want a beautiful trip why not start with a beautiful crystal,Oshino_Meme,"This is the issue with this sorta thing, it can sound like gibberish. I’ll try explain it though it’s worth noting that a lot of this will be generally or sorta correct at this level of detail as opposed to being absolutely true (thermodynamics is very complex).

Basically you’ve got a solution consisting of a solvent (e.g. naphtha) and a solute (DMT), which for a given set of conditions (temperature being the main one) you can only dissolve so much of your solute in the solvent, at which point it’s saturated. You could have less than that and it’s fine, but if you have more it’s not.

Normally if you try adding more solute at that point it won’t dissolve and will just sink to the bottom, however if you then raise the temperature the solubility will increase and so you can dissolve more solid. The interesting part is when it cools, because the solubility will drop back to its previous value meaning you’ve now got a supersaturated solution and this isn’t thermodynamically favourable, so your solute needs to either precipitate or crystallize out until it’s saturated again. Crystals are funking things though and don’t like to readily form, so you’re left with a supersaturated solution that is kinda okay (metastable) however isn’t the global minimum Gibbs free energy and so if you give the system ‘a push’ it’ll change.

By having a barely (instead of heavily) supersaturated solution this metastability is a lot better, and so instead of crystals forming out of nothing (primary nucleation) you massively favour growing existing crystals (secondary nucleation). If you can stay in this region the whole time you’re crystallizing (provided you had a seed crystal to grow on) you’ll just keep growing the crystal and get a very uniform structure.

In theory you can control this well enough to only form one large boule (a single, homogeneous, non-agglomerated crystal), which for DMT would be a hexagonal prism, and would resemble a precious gem. I don’t know of anyone having successfully made one of notable size though for DMT and it is a goal of mine to make one.

552,We Need to Talk About When People Feel Worse After Ayahuasca,boaventura,"I believe that if we all journey long enough, and the medicine is potent enough, we will all eventually realize that existence is inherently neutral. That is to say, that existence is ""objectively"" *without* meaning. I don't mean meaningless! I mean we will realize that there is no objective meaning to anything, because of course meaning is but a concept/invention of the biological simian's mind. After this realization the ""real"" journey begins, imo. It's not to say one is enlightened, but it's the time to realize that there is no such *thing* and move onto  creating purpose and meaning for oneself - if that's your fancy.

Some people are so tied to their BS (belief systems), that the realization that existence is neutral will shatter many a psyche and send people into a depression because that is a belief that is very challenging to transcend. People *need* meaning, as far as I can tell, but it's not so easy for everyone to forge their own while knowing that they are making it up as they go. It's far easier to outsource meaning via religion or science, for example. Or even a career or profession, ""I am an engineer! It is what I was put on this planet to do!""

Now, this isn't to say that there aren't people out there that don't already *know* this conceptually but to experience it is another beast all together. Especially on psychedelics, which tend to be amplifiers.

Remember that scene in the Matrix when Neo finally learns ""The Truth"" and it's too much for him so he asks to be unplugged and his last words, before he purges, are: ""that's impossible! stop! let me out! let me OUT! I want OUT! Stay away from me! I don't believe it! I don't believe it...I don't believe it"" as Morpheus tries to calm him by telling him to ""just breeeeathe"" - ? That entire scene is so psychedelic! The whole movie series is like a metaphor for the the liberation of the mind, including the scene with the architect.

The plants will reveal this to us because, imo, it is as close to ""truth"" as we can approximate as primates on this rock. The truth is we will never know the truth objectively, because there is no such things outside of our own psyche, so let's focus on our own subjective truth. Or how about we reinvent truth, or get rid of the whole concept as it's only as real as we make and accept it.

We're all just making things up as we go and no one really knows what they are doing - yet there are some that do believe they know what's up and no one will convince them otherwise. And it's true and real for them, and that's beautiful. That's the beautiful paradox of life. And thank goodness, because it makes life different and interesting. At least, imo. I can understand how this can be a scary thought that would leave many people (myself included) traumatized.

As for Terrance, I've heard his last trip was too much for him according to his partner, and so he stopped using mushrooms while trying to unpack and integrate. I'm surprised it took him that long to hit the void, but to be fair, he was maxing out at 5 grams of mushrooms, which wouldn't even qualify as light ayahuasca journey today. I doubt he ever truly peaked (but who knows). It seems to me was more interested in the light show and machine elves.",0,8,em3gwhb,t3_binoo8,t1_em38nig,/r/Ayahuasca/comments/binoo8/we_need_to_talk_about_when_people_feel_worse/em3gwhb/

You’re spot on with the childbirth analogy, I tell everyone who’ll listen how similar the two experiences were for me. Surrender and breathe is the best advice for both, so hard to do in the moment though!

Congrats on your great work with the medicine and with your integration “homework”. I really admire this so much because I find surrender and integration so difficult. I didn’t tell the shamans even close to half my story, keeping the darkest parts secret. The shamans and the medicine did help me with them anyway, but i think I made it harder for them as they were working with something blurry and encrypted, and I think this impacted on integration (which I grossly underestimated).

It was really important to me not to waste the opportunity Ayahuasca gave me to start fresh (partly because I didn't want to have to taste it again any time soon haha). I personally have found meditation to just be naturally appealing to me once I realized it didn't entail trying to turn off all your thoughts, but instead just being very investigative and observational at the sensate level. I also just find it's so synergistic with psychedelic work. The psychedelics have helped me be able to jump into meditative practice very deeply right off the bat because I have some experience with the associated states, and vice versa: being able to calm my mind and cultivated heart-qualities such as loving kindness really pays off if you are getting anxious on psychedelics.   


If you want to start an every-day practice, I think it's good to remember to start small. I started with just 15 minutes a day. Sometimes when I'm really busy I still only get 10 or 15 minutes in, but other times I go over an hour. It just depends on what is going on for me. I just realized: what's the point of all this rushing around in life if I can't even take 15 minutes out of my day to just be a human! Doing so should be much more important to us than we make it.

587,How Ayahuasca cured my chronic depression and changed my worldview (for the better),JasonMGlover_author,"Go you! There is no such thing as doing meditation badly :) There is only doing meditation or not. The mind wanders even for advanced meditators. It doesn't become entirely still and concentrated (usually) without days of retreat time. Don't worry about how many times you get distracted. Just set aside some time to do it, and as long as you notice ""planning is happening"" or ""rumination is happening"" or ""day-dreaming is happening"" or ""thinking is happening"" and return to your object of meditation gently and without self-judgement, the way you would an adorable puppy you are attempting to potty train by returning to a newspaper, you are doing it 100% right. The results from meditation come from being aware of the wandering mind, and staying grounded in the present, not from eliminating thought and distraction. The process of noticing what's happening with your sensory experience and quality of mind, the process of noticing that all things arise from nothing and then pass away into nothing, and that all these mental phenomena are ""not self"" and clinging to them or being averse to them causes suffering is the practice. That's what gets you the results — be they working through emotional trauma or insights into your own mental patterning, or insights into the nature of the world. 

The word ""mindfulness"" is translated from the Pali ""sati"" which just means ""to remember."" Every time you remember to return to your meditation object (usually the breath but it could be sound, or the weight of your body, or the sensations in your hands, a mantra, etc), you are doing it. Celebrate the remembering, do not spend one second admonishing  yourself for the forgetting. 

Meditation can be soothing, but ultimately it's about waking up to what's really happening, and being at peace with it, more than anything. Sometimes that means being at peace with a chaotic mind that doesn't want to settle. 

I am not sure if you know of the ""five hindrances"" (sloth/torpor, restlessness/regret, skeptical doubt, craving, and aversion/ill-will), but these five things basically encompass every reason you become distracted during meditation. It can be helpful to notice which one it is, what it really feels like at a sensing level, to really taste ""oh, this is restlessness"" or ""oh, this is doubt"" and then return to the object and leave it at that. What you want to avoid more than anything is getting lost in the story of why any of those things are happening, but to just notice them, and let them pass like all other things: sounds, sensations, etc. To notice sound as sound, thinking as thinking, feeling as feeling, smelling as smelling, etc and nothing more. 

(Just giving you all the tools that cleared up my own misconceptions about the practice, and what really allowed me to get into it without wondering if I was bad/good at it or doing it well, so sorry if this is all old news).

This book I read right after I got back from Peru. It's not exactly something that helped with my meditation practice, but it did help me re-integrate to normal life and not have a post afterglow crash.

In terms of meditation instruction, it depends on how you want to approach it. Personally, I've had no problem approaching it from a heavily Buddhist perspective. Which means a lot of the things that have helped have been ""dharma talks"" and dharma books... however, some of these have a bit of a learning curve due to all the Pali terms and such (depending on how much exposure to Buddhism you've had). 

I really liked this book called Dhamma Everywhere by Ashin Tejaniya (he's the core teacher of someone in my meditation group who was a monk for a few years). It is helpful in terms of working on applying mindfulness to every moment of your day, instead of just on the cushion. There's a free download here: https://abhidhamma-studies.weebly.com/uploads/2/7/7/2/27729113/dhamma-everywhere-ashin-tejaniya.pdf 

I also like this book by Achaan Chah — A Still Forest Pool https://jackkornfield.com/a-still-forest-pool/

Then there is this With Each and Every Breath book by Thanissaro Bhikku (monk with a monastery in southern CA, and one of the foremost translators of the Pali cannon into English). It's a good book for learning to play with breath energy and calm the mind/body. https://www.amazon.com/Each-Every-Breath-Guide-Meditation/dp/B017DM65TM

If you are interested in going straight to the source of The Buddha himself, and reading Suttas, I recommend In The Buddha's Words as a starting point. https://www.amazon.com/Buddhas-Words-Anthology-Discourses-Teachings-ebook/dp/B003XF1LIO

As you might notice, I've been really into Theravadan Buddhism, so I haven't read a ton from a Zen or Tibetan perspective. I find Theravadan to get the most in depth into meditative theory from a dissecting the mind standpoint. You may find some of the above sort of dry or hard to get into. 

Depending on how deep you wanna go, I got really curious about the Jhanas, deep states of meditative absorption. I went on a retreat with the authors of the following book. 

https://www.amazon.com/Practicing-Jhanas-Traditional-Concentration-Meditation/dp/159030733X

The retreat was amazing, and I unlocked states of mind I'd never experienced without having to ingest psychedelics. Their method for jhana meditation is almost impossible to do outside retreat, however, as you must spend days getting into an incredibly concentrated state. 

There's a softer approach to entering jhanas taught by Leigh Brasington. I'm about to go on a month long retreat with him and check out that technique. His book is called Right Concentration. 

https://www.amazon.com/Right-Concentration-Practical-Guide-Jhanas/dp/1611802695

Using his approach, I can manage to get a nice body buzz of Piti going on a semi regular basis. It's great if you just want to make yourself feel good or do longer sits.

If what you are after is diving deep into insight meditation, and full-on going for states of awakening/enlightenment then I recommend the following two books. But keep in mind the downfall of these approaches is it can induce an obsession with striving and getting to various meditative milestones (and the more you do that the less likely they will be to occur). That said, these are the most plain-speaking language breakdowns of how the meditative path from start to streamentry/first awakening unfolds. 

Mastering The Core Teachings of the Buddha (MCTB)

The Mind Illuminated.

https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Core-Teachings-Buddha-Unusually/dp/1904658407


For more I recommend subscribing to r/streamentry — these folks are really going for it. 


All that said.... no reading will get you as far as going on silent retreat with a good teacher. If these are less accessible to you or too expensive, Goenka 10 day vipassana retreats are donation-only and available in most states across the country. Totally a good way to get deeper fast. Finding a community/sangha near you is also highly recommended, as dark stuff can come up while practicing and it's good to have support.

593,How Ayahuasca cured my chronic depression and changed my worldview (for the better),JasonMGlover_author,"Haha sorry. That's what I get for answering comments from my mailbox without seeing the context ;)

So the short version, is I basically left my body entirely and went to a place that seemed like some kind of heaven realm or Deva realm as described in Buddhism. (This was before I really knew anything about Buddhism or Buddhist cosmology). It was a lot like how people describe near death experiences. I was absolutely sure at the time that it was a space you go to after death and existed in before death. I became basically like a Deva myself, or some kind of god-like spiritual being that had powers to will things into existence. Using sound I began creating entire universes and super novas and things in this space. There was this ridiculous never ending orgasm almost of just making universes upon universes. This happened for what seemed like eons. Then I began to relax into it and began painting worlds almost like painting on a canvas. It gave me the impression that I was the architect of aspects of this world (like the world is a collaborative game of Sims that we all are helping co-create) and had very much chosen all the most challenging aspects of my own life. That I had decided to be born with a cleft to challenge myself. That I chose my own parents. That this whole life was like a game or a marathon I was running in order to grow into a more compassionate being. I also began to touch into the experience of Nirvana, and this letting go or surrendering of even that Deva like identity that exists between lives. And I could see how that would be the best thing to do ever... eventually, when I'm ready. I got the sense that the world is eternal, that life is eternal, and that we only ever stop being reborn when we decide we are ready for Nirvana, and to completely let go of it all. It totally took away my fear of death, basically convinced me this world is not our home, and was the most relaxing, soothing thing I've ever experienced. It gave all my suffering meaning, and is what really gave me more of that sort of ""the world is fine the way it is"" realization. It felt like complete enlightenment. It was this that really made me switch over to Buddhism because I just immediately knew that from what little I knew of it, it came the closest to explaining what I'd experienced. Especially its description of rebirth and Nirvana. Eventually I felt this need to find my body again so I could tell everyone else that after they died everything would be fine, and it would make all they experienced feel like no big deal at all. (Turns out telling people doesn't make a difference, because they don't believe me, or get offended by the idea their problems don't ultimately matter). I did it with five other people, and it seemed like they were all in that space with me.

For everyone else back in the material world, I was thrashing around on the ground like a maniac, and making these roaring guttural noises that were so loud the whole retreat was gathered around me to make sure I was OK. I kept saying ""RARRRR! RARRRR! RARRRR!"" over and over. Someone recorded it and I still listen to it when I want to remember what happened.

When I came out of it I said something like ""WE MADE IT! WE MADE IT! WE WENT TO HEAVEN TOGETHER! Holy shit! Why did I choose such a hard life! There were so many times I almost gave up! And then you get here and it's amazing and it's all worth it! I need to choose something easier next time!"" I told everyone we were all basically actually gods and we were all creating the world together, and were not our bodies. Then I cried tears of joy for the rest of the night. Nothing has ever been the same since then. The world seems much more dream like, and I sometimes wonder if it counts as something like the first stage of awakening on the Buddhist path. It felt like finally going home and having a giant never ending reunion with everything and everyone I'd ever loved.

Five thousand stars. Highly recommend. Would do again in an instant. I still have trouble believing it happened.

Haha I guess that wasn't very short.

597,How Ayahuasca cured my chronic depression and changed my worldview (for the better),JasonMGlover_author,"A few things you could try to ramp up: I started with a day long. If there are meditation centers near you, these are often available on a monthly or so basis. This can get you used to the flavor of spending a day doing nothing but meditating. The first retreat I went on was just three nights/four days. This was helpful for me to get used to the social dynamics of being on silent retreat (it triggered a lot of fear that I was upsetting people by being too loud or just generally being a human and taking up space, because there was no way for me to do my usual ""sorry"" ""excuse me"" and get validation that I wasn't doing anything wrong). I'm glad I got spinning on that out of the way before my longer one — gave me a lot to think about on how silly it is I didn't think I deserved to take up space and letting other people's reactions to me being their problem to deal with and not mine. That said: plenty of people have very good success on their first 10 day vipassana retreat with no prior retreat or advanced meditative experience. 

When it goes poorly for people, it's usually because they have an issue with self-compassion and their inner critic goes wild. So answer the inner critique with self-compassion and love, and you'll be good. Kinda like tripping, if you surrender to it, there's no real such thing as a ""bad trip"" — what comes up is exactly what you need to be working through.

I had some pretty deep personal revelations throughout my 10 or so sessions, but I still have my ego (you need it), I still judge people (you have to), I still have a political stance etc. It tends to be these new age hipsters riding the wave of pseudo spiritualism who boast about having drunk hundreds of times and have transcended into the ultimate, egoless neutral beings of light, when ironically they actually come across as excessively sanctimonius, self righteous and judgmental.

The empathy you come away from this kind of experience can be difficult to shake.  And I don’t necessarily mean towards other people, but also to the world as a whole.  

Being unable to turn this  off when you and her friends share with her the challenges of your material existence may seem - and I want you to be generous with my wording here since I don’t want to offend - trivial and irrelevant. 

It can be a harsh thing, realizing that we are here for a moment, and many people sleep walk their lives chasing money or safety, only to end up missing the point of the journey in the first place.

In a way it's kind of a similar effect to serving in the military. People are rightfully proud for having served but it's easy for that pride to turn into a superiority complex.

In Ayahuasca you experience things very few people have and it's easy to convince yourself that you're somehow different or better than others as a result.

603,My sister does ayahuasca ceremonies regularly. Her personality seems changed for the worse.,Supernumiphone,"I don't know her so I can't say for certain what's going on based on your short description.  However there seem to be two likely possibilities.  First is that she may be subverting her experiences to feed her ego.  This tends to happen with people who have some rigid, heavily guarded aspect of their sense of self that they're not ready to let go of.  It's particularly common among people with personality disorders.  Aya tries to show them parts of themselves that they're not ready to see, so on a subconscious level they twist those experiences around until they can be used to reinforce their dysfunction.  I don't know what the answer is for those people, but laying off of Aya is probably part of it.

Another possibility is simply that the work she's doing has brought out some dark stuff, and she's currently going through the process of healing that.  People who haven't done much (or any) work with Aya often have misconceptions about how it works.  There are ups and downs,  and things can seemingly get worse at times.  There's a lot of talk in these circles about integration but not so much about what that can look like, especially from the outside.

I've gone through some really rough times after a set of ceremonies.  These can last weeks or months.  To people on the outside seeing that, I'm sure they sometimes wonder why I would put myself through that.  But I know from experience that it's just the completion of what began in those ceremonies, and once it runs its course I will be in a better place than ever.  It can be rough going, and it's not for everyone.

It's also possible to overdo it.  There has to be adequate integration in between ceremonies.  Without that it's possible to become really ungrounded.  It's also important to have good support.  Working with these sorts of medicines gives us the opportunity to deconstruct our personalities and egos, but we need to be well grounded while reassembling them in a healthier state.

I've seen it happen to a friend who joined the church and did ayahuasca almost daily. He transformed into someone and something else... and not for the better. Aya is a difficult journey, and inevitably we feel proud that we went in and saw some stark truth. But that stark truth can be menacing at times and difficult. Repeated over and over I suppose it could bring a sense of ""better than"" that is unhealthy and inaccurate. A true spiritual journey should open hearts and bring acceptance. It sounds like she's crossed from the spiritual into the recreational... and that's what is causing her to judge.

None of these things are bad by themselves, but some people will take the concept and use it to dominate others, usually by being judgemental and pushing other people down the newly created hierarchy.

""You are less enlightened than me because i drank ayahuasca""
""I am more spiritual than you because of religion X""
""I am more progressive than you because i support oppressed entity Y""

Unfortunately I have several friends who have fallen into this trap. The only advice i can give is to try and maintain honesty with them, and point out when they are liking the smell of their own farts a little too much. When you see this kind of behaviour with people being judgemental and superior, i always try and ask them how what they are doing/saying improves their life or the lives of others.

Some people are very judgemental about the circumstances under which people drink, or whether they use other psychedelics or spiritual practices. Certain communities are even cult-like, having guru worship attitudes towards the shaman or trying to control what other people do in their lives outside the ceremonies. 

Ayahuasca tends to attract some people who are already judgemental about certain things, like vegan diets. It also attracts people who are spiritually broken by the past and desperately looking for something to fill the void. It’s hard not to let other peoples’ attitudes rub off on you when you’re spending a lot of time with them or taking powerful psychedelics together.

I really believe self love is how we heal our relationships with others.

From what I've read before, apparently it's quite common for people who are just starting on their path of self-discovery to have their egos inflated and turn into conceited assholes. I think that it might be because they may be doing something that's quite advanced, spiritually speaking, but their emotional maturity and self-awareness hasn't really caught up. Basically, these people's behaviour changed and has become ""spiritual"", but their perceptions, ideas, beliefs, etc, remain on the same level. They might fail to see that spirituality is about developing the self, which will inevitably lead to the self changing.

I know that at the beginning of my journey I was so far up my own ass I rarely saw the light of day. Hell, I still like to suck my own dick at times, I'm just more aware of my ego and its implications on my life than I was then.

I suppose another explanation from a different perspective would be that your ego is so strong at the beginning of your spiritual journey that when there is a risk of it being weakened (i.e via meditation or psychedelics), it recognises this and grows stronger, because the ego is a little ball of stubbornness that doesn't like death or change.

Oof. My path was through mushrooms, but I've been through this. 

After having many experiences and developing a deep feeling of connection to those around me, seeing people living like robots dictated by habit and social obligations brought about a deep anguish, tinged with frustration. I felt a deep need to try to shake these people out of their zombie-like lifestyles, but I also knew that I have no way of helping those who do not want to help themselves. Contrary to common belief, developing strong empathy doesn't make you magically able to heal every soul that passes you by. It was hard to avoid becoming either depressed or judgemental about this. 

This didn't improve until I stopped taking psychedelics for a long time, and made an effort to put myself back into the world of people. For me to continue functioning in civilization, it was necessary for me to make a point of re-establishing my boundaries; I had to worry less about others and try to simply enjoying my ride through reality for what it was rather. 

I realized that even if I want to, I can't save everyone from the web that is their lives. All I can do is work on myself, and help anybody else around me who is trying to do the same for themselves. I now try to take a step back and save my empathy for those who trust me and want my help.

There are a lot of people who exploit Ayahuasca for dark reasons, including shamans. I’ve seen people go through similar things also. Sometimes it’s also really hard because Ayahuasca and spiritual circles can be so ego centric and unhealthy and if you’re really open and taking Ayahuasca, or even meditating a lot, you are way more susceptible to absorbing and taking on those beliefs and behaviours and even energies yourself. If I were in your position I would search or a healer/energy worker that you really really trust and I would talk to them about it and see if they have any guidance. Praying for guidance with this can be helpful whether you believe in prayer or not. Also sitting your sister down to talk about this could be good?

644,My sister does ayahuasca ceremonies regularly. Her personality seems changed for the worse.,orange_octopus,"I really think this is the answer.

OP mentioned the sister has struggles, pain, has always been a spiritual seeker.  That is the wound seeking healing.  Ayahuasca calls those who need it.  But the process has several stages, and stage one is the revealing, the pulling away of the personality structures and facades, and it seems now that her ego is resisting this, she has lost her happy-go-lucky facade but is not ready to be with her pain so she projects it out.  


In the traditional Amazon communities, they might recommend a retreat of several months to work through deep-seated trauma.  Maybe she needs to unplug from her daily life and focus more intently on her healing.  This is the solution rather than ""quitting"" ayahuasca - once you've uncovered the wound, you can't replace the scab.    


In the meantime feel free to talk to her in a loving way and hold her accountable for the state of her relationship with you.  This is something her shaman should be encouraging and I wonder about the community she is working with if they are not emphasizing keeping good relationships while working through the process.

Hang on. No-one is saying that psychotherapy is the perfect cure for everyone, but it clearly does help some people. Likewise ayahuasca is not a perfect cure for everyone, but it clearly also helps some people

If we can agree that the above statement is true that why is it OK to roll your eyes and be dismissive of something that helps people? Just be glad that people are getting  help where they find it most effective. It sucks that you didnt get what you needed from conventional sources but thats you, for other people it works fine so dont be an eye rolling  douche about it.

You are turning this topic into something it is not.

No-one is asking about whether you will follow up on psychotherapy.
No-one is trying to force their opinion of western medicine onto you.
No one is trying to intrude into your business or your process.
The topic is not about people getting all up in your face about what does and does not work for you.
It’s not about you.

It’s about people becoming so absorbed in plant medicines that they start becoming judgmental, passive aggressive, and self-righteous, about anything that isn’t plant medicines. 

I’m not dismissing any of your own experiences, I’m simply saying that the passive aggressive eye rolling, that you openly say you would do is unnecessary, and is the exact problem that the OP wrote about. 

You also clearly misunderstood the use of “civility aside” in the comment from orange_octopus, just as you misunderstood the word “argument” earlier.

I always suffered from anger, impulsive behavior, and depression(though I never realized it till after ayahuasca) and after the plant medicine everything was just.... good. It was good to be here. Good to give and accept love. Good to live. 

Also totally agree with the “work” you have to do in everyday life to reap the benefits. It’s not a one way ticket. You have to want to be happy. But, fuck, I’ve never felt better or more alive and it’s been years since my last ceremony. I love this post and you as well sister. Power on.

I hope this persists for you, given that you’re putting a lot of attention and energy into the post-ceremonies Integration, it seems that it will. Reading your post, you almost sound like a former-BPD in how you are now so empathetic toward others and can “see” through their eyes in a way that many people with BPD seems to struggle to do,  often because they are so consumed with their own pain. 

One point about vomiting and nausea as a side effect. I think of purging not as a “side effect” but a central part of the healing.  We purge negativity and things we want to leave behind. It sounds like that’s what you’re doing.

I can really relate to that, word for word. I have drank ayahuasca around 20 times. I only vomited once, the first one, and like you I purged for hours, even after the ceremony--I had to crawl out of bed and stumble over to the bathrooms. It was hell. But I felt like I purged a lifetime of guilt, shame, regret, resentments -- very much like your list. 3+ years later I still regard that night as the most transformative and meaningful day of my life.",1,6,e7w5llz,t3_9opq8o,t1_e7vup97,/r/Ayahuasca/comments/9opq8o/my_experience_as_someone_with_borderline/e7w5llz/

723,DO NOT go to Soulquest Ayahuasca Church in Orlando.,NischalaSQ,"Hello Hojoon, thank you for your review. Believe it or not we find value in reviews such as yours. We do not typically do such large Ceremonies, however, having the Shaman here many of our regulars requested to come. Since we had so many experienced drinkers coming and we are well staffed it was allowed. We have all agreed even before you wrote this review that we would never allow for that many participants again. We simply wanted all people who wanted to sit with the Shaman be able to come. You are right, it was too much. As far as privacy is concerned, dorms are not the only option. We do have 4 private yurts and plenty of land for people to pitch tents. I am not sure how you didn't manage to find privacy on 5 acres of land. The gift of having so much Nature around is that people CAN get away from the crowd and connect with Nature, Stillness and the Self. Also, neither you or your wife joined us in the Integration Circle which we see as a KEY component to the work that we do here. You would have witnessed all of the Healing that DID occur AND you would have had a chance to speak up for your needs during Ceremony we would have happily accommodated them. We often have people who we need to move further from the group or that we prepare space for inside because being around other people, music, etc. is not in alignment with their needs. As you well know Ayahusca heightens all of our senses and with so much energy in one space it can be overwhelming and/or distracting for some people. We wish you would have felt comfortable enough to sit in the Circle and voice your needs so that we could have created ideal space for you and your Beloved, or at least we wish you would have felt comfortable to come to Nischalã Lindsay Johnson or Chris to let us know that you and your wife needed some adjustments in your personal Ceremony space.  Ofcourse, we wish that your experience had been positive for you and we pray that over the coming days you and your Wife receive what you need from Mother Ayahuasca. Perhaps the lesson was simply to listen to your intuition. We ARE NOT Peru and we do not pretend to be. Our Ceremonies pull from many traditions. We are most certainly NOT a cult, we welcome and create safe space for ALL Spiritual Paths and we HONOR ALL PATHS and in no way shape or form try to impose our personal Spiritual beliefs on others. There are plenty of people who can vouch for this. We have many people return here BECAUSE of the Loving Atmosphere. YES!!! Community is extremely important to us. It is of utmost importance to us that people can come here and feel free to be who they are and express themselves without shame. We recognize as humans our work is to learn to Respect each other and to function as a Human Family.  Washing away illusions of separateness.  People who have not experienced a healthy, loving, supportive atmosphere would be/are uncomfortable in community because it is not something they are used to feeling.  Cults impose their beliefs of people.  Even our staff have varying Spiritual Beliefs. It is laughable that you would call us a cult.  We create a safe container for people to find their own Truths and that is very important to us. We wish you would have felt comfortable expressing yourself when you were here, as I said we certainly would have accommodated your needs, but you did't give us a chance to. We are Soul Quest Church of Mother Earth and we do our best to stay in alignment with the Sacred Teachings of the Ayahuasca Manifesto in which Mother Ayahuascsa encourages the development of Her Medicine out side of the jungle and into other cultures. We are doing our best be Mindful of how we cultivate Ayahuasca Ceremony within the United States. However, we are not here to copy any one tradition.  We incorporate Wisdom from many Spiritual Traditions.   We are constantly learning and growing and I can PROMISE you our motivation is not money. We have a large staff, and we have to pay the overhead to keep this place up and running plus we have to pay our Shaman. We barely break even most of the time. Although, it takes a lot of money to run a Center this size, money is not our motivation. The Healing is. The reason we operate as a Church is to provide ourselves and members with protection.  And we have held space for and seen MASSIVE healing within many.  Furthermore, we are currently working hard to make the Center more comfortable, safe and accommodating. We are currently working on putting up a geocentric dome for Ceremonies which will not only create a safer and more specious area for Ceremony but it will free up the patio space and offer another indoor area for people to BE. We are also working on a greenhouse project to do our part in keeping these Sacred Plants available. And we have goals to put up more private accommodations as well. You have no idea what it goes into running Soul Quest. We are human and it is extremely challenging.  The time and energy that it takes to run these Ceremonies is tremendous.  We can't expect people to sacrifice of themselves for free to do such taxing work. Fair exchange for work is ethical and important.  If you are expecting the Peru experience when you come here you will be disappointed. The reason we have Maestro Gaspar and Kent, as well as other Teaches,  come here from Peru and other places is because we want to learn as much as we can so that we may constantly learn to Honor Mother Ayahuasca, Our Selves and the World Better. Did you take the opportunity to connect with Maestro Gaspar? He is from Peru and has been working with with Ayahuasca since he was 14. Did you allow your self to go to him during Ceremony or to have a private consultation with him?  You or your wife did not take participate in the Integration Circle, nor the FREE Yoga class or FREE Breathwork sessions ALL of which drastically enhance and support your experience.  We can offer opportunities, we can not force you to take them. How do you expect to get the benefit of our facility when you barely participated in what we offer, not did you ask us for assistance in adjusting your Ceremony space.  We can not help you if you don't express your needs. We fully understand and recognize what you are saying. We Hear You and will we adjust ourselves accordingly, but we will never be Peru, nor are we trying to be. Thank you for your input and Blessings on your Journey.  We hope you and your Wife appreciate your refunds and use that money to invest in something that does bring you Peace.

I do agree that they should cut down on the attendees and that it does have a sort of cult vibe. But if you are trying to get ayahuasca in the united States by people that somewhat know what they are doing, it's them. The only other places in the US that even remotely do it either aren't American citizens or they have had someone die. The place in Tennessee were giving people pizza and soda after their ceremonies. I can see where your concerns are. But I would recommend calling Chris if you ever choose to do it again and ask if you can get a weekend where there aren't alot of people there.

731,DO NOT go to Soulquest Ayahuasca Church in Orlando.,Dr_Nodzofalot,"I used to think it was expensive too. Then I paid two ayahuasceros (a couple) 300$ to attend a circle of about 10 people. After watching and listening to at least four of the attendees completely lose their shit for hours and seeing how effective this couple was at handling it and helping people get thru it I did some rough assessing. In order to make this evening happen this couple:

-Flew to Peru
-brewed the brew
-smuggled it home at great risk to themselves, without getting busted. This is a drug as illegal in the US as heroin and LSD.
-administered it in their own home to a group of people that are screened beforehand or are repeat customers. Also a significant risk.
-babysat several people who came completely unglued and had to be attended to constantly for long periods.
-wiped up the shit and puke afterwords. 
-served everybody breakfast the next morning

They took in 3 grand that night. It cost them at least 2 grand. So they each made 500$.
Conclusion: at these prices, this is practically charity work. At least in this case.

733,DO NOT go to Soulquest Ayahuasca Church in Orlando.,HoMaster,"Let’s clear up some things.

When I booked for the July 21-23 weekend sessions, only the dorm choices were available on your website.  This means that the other options weren’t available— they were whitewashed out.  So, that means either you did have not have other booking options available as per your website, or your organization is so disorganized that you don’t even know what was available and when.  This does not come as a surprise as this is a running theme.

In regard to privacy, I mentioned it in terms of the bathroom and toilets, not in terms of the rooms.  Your toilets and showers had plastic curtains as a means of securing privacy.  You really should read again the ONE line I mentioned privacy.  As far as dorm privacy is concerned, I knew what I was getting myself into.  I know what shared dorm beds and hostel conditions are like— I used to live in, own, and run a hostel in Eastern Europe for 8 years.

You suggest I pitch tents and go roam on your land for privacy when I specifically asked Chris in an email before I booked if the rooms had AC.  I cannot stand to step foot in Florida due to the tortuous humidity and you expect me to just go out and pitch a tent and get eaten by Florida mosquitos?  And this isn’t even the point.  The point is I should not have to be running into 20 people on my way to the bathroom and then wait in line because of high demand because there was, as you admitted, just too many people.

I did not attend the Integration Circle because my lower back was hurting badly from your cheap mattress and because of the stress of having so many people around I didn’t feel spiritually well either.  I urged my wife to attend the Integration Circle Saturday evening because this was her first experiences with ayahuasca and I wanted her to benefit from that.  AND SHE DID ATTEND the integration circle and the ayahuasca session that night.  I’m again not surprised by you and your staff not even noticing- its hard to keep track of what 40 people are doing when no one is one the same page, and it’s even more hectic when you count on the weather being cooperative since you are in no way equipped to handle 40 attendees plus 10 staff members for any kind of Circle in the event of rain.

“You would have witnessed all of the Healing that DID occur.” I don’t deny the benefits of ayahuasca.  I find it amusing that you had to stick that in there as if I was a non-believer.  If I attended the Integration Circle and said there was way too many people here, about 30 too many, would they have magically disappeared?  My wife, Elena, did say ask Chris to come talk to me that night and yet he nor anyone else did, to which is immaterial to me.

“As you well know Ayahuasca heightens all of our senses and with so much energy in one space it can be overwhelming and/or distracting for some people.”

You mean like literally lining up people in rows right next to each other? Would you like to see a photo that I took?

“We wish you would have felt comfortable expressing yourself when you were here, as I said we certainly would have accommodated your needs, but you did't give us a chance to.”

I find it telling that you find nothing you did wrong except for having too many people yet all the problems that that caused is my fault for not speaking out about it.  I gave your organization a chance by attending it in person, so I really don’t know what you’re trying to do except deflect blame back unto us.

If the reason as you say is for more people to experience Maestro Gaspar, then why not stagger the ceremony dates?  Then why cram 50 people into one house?  This dilutes and degrades the experience for EVERYONE who attended. I already mentioned this several times and this is the main contention I had, of which is the main source of malaise of all, yet you say you made an error but go on to ignore the consequences of that error.

“Furthermore, we are currently working hard to make the Center more comfortable, safe and accommodating. We are currently working on putting up a geocentric dome for Ceremonies which will not only create a safer and more specious area for Ceremony but it will free up the patio space and offer another indoor area for people to BE.”

So you admit your current facilities are inadequate, not spacious, and not safe?

“We are also working on a greenhouse project to do our part in keeping these Sacred Plants available. And we have goals to put up more private accommodations as well. You have no idea what it goes into running Soul Quest. We are human and it is extremely challenging.”

You’re right I do not know and I do imagine it to be a lot of work—  I used to run a small business catering to people so I know it from that aspect.  I do wish the best of luck to you and your group so that you can become organized and professional in your services instead of being the mess I experienced.

“If you are expecting the Peru experience when you come here you will be disappointed. The reason we have Maestro Gaspar and Kent come here is because we want to learn as much as we can so that we may constantly learn to Honor Mother Ayahuasca, Our Selves and the World Better. Did you take the opportunity to connect with Maestro Gaspar? He is from Peru and has been working with with Ayahuasca since he was 14. Did you allow your self to go to him during Ceremony or to have a private consultation with him?”

For an additional fee of course, in addition to having paid $150 for the church membership fee, $450 for the 2 ayahuasca sessions, and $70 for a dorm bed, for a total of $670.  This was a very off-putting aspect of the weekend.  You had every new age spiritual remedy available, offered by staff members— all for a fee of course.  We were solicited a couple of times.  I’m sure there are people out there who buy into anything and perhaps it does work for them— placebo effect is proven to work.  I personally, am a person of science.  And yes I have to include this disclaimer that I believe in ayahuasca after having done it myself and reading on scientific journals, before all the ayahuasca pitchforks come out.

I never expected Peru.  To expect Peru from a weekend is ridiculous.  I just didn’t expect your organization to be a brimming hostel with ayahuasca.  I really wish you would stop thinking and saying that I expected your organization to ever be like Peru— that is ludicrous.  What I expected was some kind of organization and not a shit show.  I sincerely hope you guys get your act together and get organized.

He is neither enclosed by the creation nor is any part of the creation above Him in anyway. He is not part of the created world nor is it a part of Him. In fact, His Being is totally distinct and separate from His creation. He is the Creator and the universe and its contents are all a part of His creation...  ALLAH IS ALLAH, AND THE CREATION IS CREATION. Two separate entities, the Creator and the created, the Infinite and the finite... He is unique in His divinity and nothing is similar to Him... This false attribute of divine immanence (the 'God is everywhere' belief) leads to dangers of shirk as then man turns to worship of creation rather than of the Creator...

I think it is vitally important that people who are looking to try Aya read accounts such as this. Ayahuasca is not a miracle cure for everyone and we need to accept that. Reading your post made me realise the importance of having some form of professional screening for Aya and unfortunately that can only happen when western medicine accepts it as viable therapy.

Regarding screening:

You mentioned your history of mild dissociation. Unfortunately there is not a lot of observed science to back this up, but I have read that ayahuasca can be risky for those with dissociation or dissociative disorder. Individuals with such a history should probably avoid psychedelics until we know more.

Also, you mention:

>No I haven't taken a psychedelic before Peru

Having experienced and read about ayahuasca for several years, I have arrived at the conclusion that it would be safer for people to start with small doses of psilocybin mushrooms and, if all goes well, work their way up to ayahuasca, to lower (although not eliminate) the uncommon but very real risk of having a truly damaging ayahuasca experience. I wrote more on this here: [Negative side effects after doing ayahuasca and my recovery](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ayahuasca/comments/7tmv8e/negative_side_effects_after_doing_ayahuasca_and/dtf8u0o/)

Owing to the many incredibly good stories about ayahuasca, too many people discount the very real risks.

That being said, I know that you know the risks and as you say, you rolled the dice. I am just trying to think of ways to screen out those such as yourself who might be harmed. Please understand that I am not trying to blame you at all.

Also, I hate to say this, but what you write is so good, and people need to read this, but I think many will be intimidated by the long wall of text.

I have been at that suicidal breach many times, almost on the verge of a heart attack and no one could talk me out of it. It's an all enveloping fear and fear is very real.

As far as not being able to do little tasks, maybe it's because in the midst of doing them prior to your experience, you couldn't hear the feelings and thoughts you've been blocking out all of these years as you've been trying to hold down an element of normalcy, and now you can hear your wild side and maybe now life feels more like a cage than a choice.

Some comments.

I'd say that, the medicine was working in some way, and the form in which you took it isn't helping much. My understanding of the Shipibo ceremonies is that it is oriented more towards bringing someone back into balance with the village (community). 

It's the Metizso shamans ... the ones of mix blood, not indigenous, and often do this in urban settings, that conduct ceremonies more for individual healing. If there had been a breakthrough in the ceremonies you attended, working with the Shipibo would probably help you reintegrate back into the community at large.

I also agree that, too much, too fast is not going work well. I have heard of shamans who, work on you by drinking the Ayahuasca, but you yourself would not.

Some other thoughts too: have you considered EMDR for therapy? The tapping protocol can surface up  some of the truama, but doesn't do it all at once. The tapping helps the neurons make sense of the signals so that it sort itself out, from bottom to top (rather than the top to bottom of CBT). It still requires a lot of courage, and mindfulness -- so it isn't as if you throw away the path you have already walked too. That is, if it shakes it up just enough for you to still stay mindful, you would go a long way. And later, as the brain starts being able to put words to the truama, you 

If you are still interested in spirit medicine (and it sounds more like, you were desparate to try any modality, rather than specifically spirit medicine), there are a lot of other shamanic practices. Like drumming. Though, I advise finding an EMDR therapist first before trying the drumming; the drumming can act like that tapping protocol I am talking about, but the people doing it may not structure it as a therapy.

Another ... and I'm not even sure you can find such a practitioner ... is a Chodpa, someone initiated into Chöd of Mahamudra.

824,How I lost my rope and ended up hospitalized after an Ayahuasca Retreat,420sm0ke420,"Sorry to hear about your experience. I’m just concerned what made you think to try Aya as your first psychedelic. To me it’s like choosing a Ferrari for your first car to drive. You have to learn and start slowly. You can learn from other psychedelics, LSD, mushrooms, etc. as well. In my experience though it’s for people who don’t have mental issues. People that are not confident in themselves, insecure etc I’ve seen have issues. I guess you went the route of wanting to use it to fix your issues. This to me sounds like throwing gasoline on a fire. In my opinion, I think you need to have your issues figured out before you try psychedelics not the other way around. Otherwise this is what can happen. 

Sorry if what I said is of no help. I just know growing up as a teen it took me a long time to just be able to understand and smoke weed. Just smoking weed I realized a lot about myself and insecurities when I was young, it taught me about myself and to be aware of myself. I couldn’t imagine diving headfirst into Aya. I’m in my mid 30s now and having numerous psych experiences mainly LSD and mushrooms and mdma, while I was younger. I’m just now considering Aya or dmt. Even so I’m feeling very cautious of what I’m wanting to try. I know from experience the power, strength, good, bad and the different types of experiences that can occur with psychs, where I’m going mentally, expectations, etc. 

To me what you went through is like getting in a Ferrari for your first car to drive. Though I don’t know where you got the idea for first timers to try such a serious and powerful psych and on top of that to have existing and previous mental issues. I thought it was common knowledge that if you have existing issues, prone to schizophrenia and if you try psychedelics it can make your situation worse and/or bring out underlying issues. Did you know this before you went on your retreat? Or did you want to ignore it and just hope you were going to be “healed” like others seem to say? I think you’re very brave for sure to try it with all your issues, I would be scared. I want to be as clear headed as possible and not have anything on my mind, no stress, not sick etc before I try it for the first time.

I also sought the help of ayahuasca for help with symptoms that were rooted in trauma.  I had tried countless therapies prior to that unsuccessfully.   


For a full year after my ceremony (double 2 night ceremony), my illness regressed into the worst it had ever been in the entire 11 years that I had been sick.  I reached the lowest points I had ever reached.  During that time I had so many of the same thoughts that you shared about having (that I was depending on it too much, expecting too much, didn't have a good integration plan, etc.)  And of course I was highly distressed because of overall disappointment in ayahuasca ceremony, and increased hopelessness.   Well, after that year, over about another six month period, my illness finally lifted and I have been completely free of it now for the last 6 years now.  The way I see it is that I took a whole year to process what was stirred up in that ceremony, and being temporarily worse was just the layers of my illness rising to the surface and then finally exiting. 

I am still dealing with many manifestations of the core trauma, so my work is not done, but working through that particular illness was a big step for me in overall healing.

835,How I lost my rope and ended up hospitalized after an Ayahuasca Retreat,zooft,"hey! Thanks for your comment.
Yes I agree that there should be a good screening in place. The problem is still that it is nearly impossible to predict what arises with Aya which could be for example a lot of trauma charge in the implicit memory systems from which we don't have conscious awareness of. The Center I went to did a very good screening and I know they don't accept all people. I even had two preparation skype calls with an experienced facilitator and she decided I woud be okey to go. They didn't do anything wrong and I also didn't.... I simply rolled the dice and ""lost"". 
I am not even sure if Ayahuasca should become part of Western Medicine since it comes from such far away concepts and is a very advanced tool I would say at least in the treatment of serious mental health issues. There comes the whole issue around appropriating and westernizing it with ""our"" psychological concepts etc... Of course that doesn't mean psychedelic medicines shouldn't be taken into consideration for treatment. I only think that Ayahuasca is probably not the first option for the reasons I just mentioned.
No I haven't taken a psychedelic before Peru. Like I described in my post I was seriously searching for therapists who were experienced in this. I found two actually but didn't feel right with them and the sense of them not having a good foundation in trauma or somatic oriented approaches but rather esoteric ones didn't make the setting feel safe.... and I mean spiritual bypassing is a thing with these substances.

837,How I lost my rope and ended up hospitalized after an Ayahuasca Retreat,zooft,"hey! Yes I agree that starting with an ""easier"" psychedelic makes a lot of sense. There is a podcast with a psychedelic experienced psychiatrist who supports that, too. Maybe MDMA is even the first thing to try in a safe context and not a classic psychedelic which can open you up with much less support and I think that is the danger of psychedelics.... too much, too fast. Smashing through defenses I thought would be the way to go but I started to understand and recognize that defenses are really there to protect you even though they are dysfunctional in many ways. Therefore it is healthier and safer to negotiate with them and slowly look behind those walls since there can be a big charge which can lead to a retraumatization and not integration (healing).

Thanks for your comment. Yes I considered EMDR but I found a good SE (Somatic Experiencing) therapist which is a well established body oriented method to work slowly and carefully with trauma.
Concerning the Shipibo understanding of healing I agree that their approach is not oriented towards the individual as much as to the smaller community. That's where the problems begin since most of us don't live in small communities and also have a more individual sense self if we like it or not. It's a complicated matter and yes you are right that I wanted to try a modality which is far away from conventional psychiatry/psychology since I was very frustrated and quiet hopeless since I didn't improve after trying a lot of things. Now I understand that it doesn't have to be the furthest away modality and I am gaining trust in therapies dealing directly with trauma and have the aspect of retraumatization addressed.

841,How I lost my rope and ended up hospitalized after an Ayahuasca Retreat,zooft,"Hey! Thanks for your comment. Yes it's great that you therapist can spot your dissociation because then you can work with it together rather than just talk talk talk and nothing moves. Having a witness of this isolating ""not"" feeling can become a gateway to reconnect even though it takes time and sometimes persists for a while I think it is essential for psychotherapy to work.

Concerning MDMA assisted work I am working actually to find the right setting for that. The success from the MAPS studies is for sure the combination of very experienced therapists and the substance. The window of possible work which opens up during the effects needs to be worked with to have longterm outcomes. They take a non-directive approach but at the same time they support you when needed and turn your attention back inwards when they perceive you talking and circling around issues and avoiding in the end.

852,How I lost my rope and ended up hospitalized after an Ayahuasca Retreat,payitforward3,"I’m not suggesting you should drink more ayahuasca but I do think that drinking more does help some people- it did for me, so it’s certainly not bullshit. My first ceremony was pure hell- like many other people experience. I had no breakthrough, no relief. I was shaken to my core after that. I looked like I had seen a ghost and had dark circles under my eyes. I felt like I was dragged by a horse all night long and left to wither away. I did have a lot of support from the owner and staff of the center I was at. Actually, doing yoga right away grounded me and made me feel better. I’m so glad I drank more the next night because I had a completely healing and peaceful night then. I can only imagine how worse off I would be if I left the center after one night and most of the horror stories I hear are from those who do just that. Still, based on your posts it sounds like you were in a much worse place than I was after my first ceremony. 

But you didn’t do that; you didn’t leave. You had the courage and will to try it again, several times! It sounds like you did everything the “right” way in your preparation, although I’ve heard people recommend staying off meds for much longer , up to a year beforehand.. but then you also hear people say you can take them up to two weeks or less beforehand.. so who knows what it was..? Whether it blew you open too quickly too fast or maybe it just doesn’t work with your brain chemistry? 

This is subjective and based on my experience and those of my friends: As far as becoming traumatized by ceremonies and drinking more, I feel like that happens when a person is not unraveling the root issues and They continue to repress or ignore it. That’s what causes anxiety and depression for me. Whether it’s a repressed issue or not, those feelings are like a beacon. But, if a person drinks aya over and over and doesn’t have a breakthrough, yet has more trauma, I would not recommend drinking it anymore. Maybe take a break for a while. Lots of people drink a bunch and take a year or a few years off. Or maybe just decide not to drink it ever again. Admittedly this is uncharted territory for me and thanks for discussing it with me. I feel like this is helpful for me and hopefully others who read your thread. :-) 

As far as the past lives stuff, I asked because past life regression has helped many people in your situation. It has benefited many people who had weird, unexplainable, uncomfortable and nonstop feelings that did not make sense to them- even suicidal thoughts. it seems like it might be relevant for you. Maybe not. You don’t need to believe it in for it to work. You just need to find a reputable therapist to do the session(s). I would not recommend exploring that during aya ceremonies at this point! 

I also want to say that you know what, you are much stronger now that you went through this experience. Give yourself credit. You went through some extremely difficult shit and you are on the other side of it. I hope you continue to heal and find meaning of it all..

854,How I lost my rope and ended up hospitalized after an Ayahuasca Retreat,zooft,"Hey! Thanks for discussing things. Sorry for using the term ""bullshit"" here. You are right that sometimes it needs a couple of ceremonies for people to discover root causes and work through them. Most certainly one ceremony normally isn't enough. There were some people in my retreat who for example at first had very physical ceremonies and after that memories (in metaphorical visions or literal form) came back and were able to work with them with the good support and preparation from the facilitators and curandera/curandero before, during and after the ceremonies. I think when things are moving in ceremony and you kind of get grounded afterwards again (even when rattled) it makes often times sense to keep going when you feel ready for it again on a gut level.

For me simply nothing moved emotionally in ceremonies. I mean when I took higher doses I got intense visuals which were a little bit fear inducing since I didn't have any psychedelic experiences before that but I felt blocked at the time and now I understand that I was probably in a dissociated state. I wanted to get to the roots of my issues which was my intention for the whole retreat but now I understand that having intention and willingness to go there is not working when your psychological defenses or ""nervous system"" doesn't let you. I agree that anxiety and depression is part of that defense and the question is how to navigate that. Therefore I think it is crucial to have a sense of safety on a gut level to be able to get to the emotional charge which is held behind the defenses like depression (which is maybe the organisms attempt to repress emotions), anxiety and dissociation. This safety can to some extend be provided from the outside and in realtionship to that outside. Equally or probably even more importantly a ""good enough"" inner stability and grounding to be able to go and lovingly peek around the defenses and take on the emotions and memories waiting there to be processed.
This is speculative and I am just trying to make sense of my experience but I think for me Ayahuasca might attacked my defenses and tried to get them out of the way aggressively but then those insisted to not get broken down to kind of protect me since I didn't feel save enough there and didn't have the inner stability for that. So now I need to stabilize and find ways to work more carefully with what's behind those protectors.

Also, a lot of retreats capitalize on the benefits aya has on depression. If the shaman doesn't want such profiles to come and drink, he should make a selection beforehand and have a discussion with everyone, even before they pay for the retreat.

Finally, people have crazy reactions to aya. Some without being in a bad place beforehand. There have been many cases of people being mentally broken for awhile after a ceremony.

916,Unwanted sexual advances during ceremony arranged by Manaus Jungle Tours / Amazing Tours Agency,lavransson,"I'm so sorry to hear this. It's great that you're posting thee reviews as a warning to others.

I'd suggest adding the shaman's name to your reviews, if you got his name. I suspect that other tour operators might be using the same shaman, and that he might be operating independently as well. 

I think this is an example of how you have to be cautious with some tour operators who book everything from paragliding to fishing trips to ayahuasca. They are just middlemen who have a loose connection of buddies who they call for bookings, and the middleman (tour operator) gets a booking fee. The operators can't possibly vet all their subcontractors adequately. I'd be especially cautious finding an ayahuasca ceremony this way.

Ayahuasca is serious business, something you want to do only with trusted people. And even the places with good reputations sometimes get a black eye.

I hope none of this comes across as blaming-the-victim as that's not my intention--this is just a warning to others.

I'm so sorry this happened to you but I admire how you got away from him and posted this. I hope you get a chance for another ceremony with an ethical shaman. ",1,13,daf0feq,t3_5etdc1,t3_5etdc1,/r/Ayahuasca/comments/5etdc1/unwanted_sexual_advances_during_ceremony_arranged/daf0feq/

A few months ago I met a ""shaman"" from Colombia who travels around the world holding ayahuasca ceremonies and is quite well known. I saw many people come to him for healings, although it seemed like most were male. I didn't drink with him, but this shaman got inappropriately touchy feely with me and made alot of efforts to get me alone. he ended up messaging me on facebook for weeks after we met with love poems and compliments. I've heard of many other similar stories from women and I'm grateful that more people are speaking up. It's just creepy to think that these men can create very convincing personas for themselves as shamans and healers.

Sexual assault is not to be taken lightly and should be dealt with through the proper channels, not automatically posting it on the internet. You made some *incredibly* poor decisions that you should be held accountable for:

1.
> ..I know this was dumb but I'm a bit of a thrill-seeker..
>It wasn't the smartest decision I've made but sometimes my sense of adventure takes over :P

**- This is not funny, nor cute, nor you being ""adventurous"".** You made a series of poor decisions that could have resulted in real consequences. Now you are taking this public and putting an entire company at risk. Reading through TripAdvisor reviews, it is clear that people's experiences with Manaus are overwhelmingly positive. S.America is THE JUNGLE, 2nd/3rd world countries, your lack of ability to make good decisions doesn't cut it.

2. You were looking for a quick Ayahuasca ""fix"". That's not how Aya works. 

3. Clearly you did not do your research. You went with a company that specializes in *Tours*, not Ayahuasca. Of all things offered by Manaus, ""Ayahuasca Ceremony"" is number 21 on their list. I discovered this by spending 30 seconds on their website.

4. Ignored multiple red flags; 
-Who books an ayahuasca ceremony via WhatsApp???
-The ""temple"" being the shamans home
-Seemingly nonexistent vetting process to verify that you are not on medications and/or a crazy person. 
-Doing a 1-on-1 ceremony with a shaman whose name you do not even know. 

> if you're like me and do find yourself taking ayahuasca in a somewhat sketchy situation...

Or, just don't put yourself in the situation to begin with. It takes 10 minutes of research to find numerous, reputable Ayahuasca retreat centers who have all the necessary security measures in place.

In the end, it wasn't the experience I wanted but I like to take everything as just that, an experience, whether good or bad. As a solo female who's traveled a lot, I understood the risks going into it and tbh I'm not that surprised about what happened to me. I'm glad I got to enjoy the ayahuasca until that point and that I got away before things escalated. Anyway, I'll be happy if this helps at least one woman avoid this agency/shaman! I guess someone's gotta be the guinea pig, right?

And I understand that your post isn't meant to blame the victim. I agree that booking a ceremony through a tour operator isn't the best--but it seemed somewhat legit given the agency's certificate of excellence on trip advisor and that I had met someone who independently recommended Ayahuasca through Leonard. I definitely jumped the gun though since my other plans fell through and it was my last night in Brazil. My question to you though is, if you were me, how would you have gone about finding ""trusted people""?

926,Unwanted sexual advances during ceremony arranged by Manaus Jungle Tours / Amazing Tours Agency,femaletraveler2016,"Thanks for the comment. I'd like to respond to a few things:

1. To be clear, I do not take sexual assault lightly. That's why I am posting here. At the same time though, I'm not going to sit around and wallow in self pity or beat myself up for the mistakes I made. The only thing I can do is make sure I don't repeat those mistakes and try to keep others from ending up in my situation. What is the proper channel you would recommend? Do you think I should go to the police? As you said, this is a 2nd/3rd world country--going to the police isn't that easy and I haven't met one who speaks english yet (also Manaus is in Brazil, not Peru, but I get your point). And as you said, I made dumb decisions and in the end I got away and nothing happened. Do you think the police are going to do anything?

2. I think it's a misrepresentation to say I was looking for a quick Aya fix. I've read a lot about it and I've smoked 5-Meo-DMT so I understand that it's a powerful drug. I had other plans through a good friend but that didn't work out because the water was too rough to take a boat out to his temple/shaman. So he recommended I find something in Manaus. I spoke with someone at my hostel who said they had done Ayahuasca with Manaus Jungle Tours so I had more confidence in it. And as you said, the reviews on TripAdvisor are generally great. 

3. Pretty much everyone communicates over Whats Apps here, it's just like texting/calling. I spoke with Leonardo on the phone (over whats app) for about 15-20 min. He asked me various questions about medications, etc. Sounded like it was legit. And like I said, when I first arrived, there were other people there. You said it takes 10 minutes of research to find numerous, reputable Ayahuasca retreat centers who have all the necessary security measures in place? Can you point me to them please? Furthermore, many reputable retreat centers also have histories of taking advantage of women sexually and to say that you can find one that is completely safe in 10 minutes is also reckless. I'm sure this happens at reputable places as well. 

4. Leonardo has not responded to any of my calls or messages since I left the temple and that is why I am posting here. I think the title accurately reflects what happened: I experienced unwanted sexual advances during a ceremony arranged by Manaus Jungle Tours / Amazing Tours Agency. But yeah, ""Don't be me: How not to do Ayahuasca"" works too. I'm not excusing my poor decision making--I know I'm responsible for my own safety--but I also can't let the agency and Leonardo off the hook. On the phone, Leonardo said this is the only shaman he uses and that he's the only one he trusts with his clients. I think there is something sketchy about him because if you look at the 10 1-star reviews on TripAdvisor (I wish I had done this before), you'll see that many call him a con man. 

Here's one example: https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g303235-d1936812-r430663822-Amazing_Tours_Agency_Day_Tour-Manaus_Amazon_River_State_of_Amazonas.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT

Regardless of my recklessness that night, I think its clear that no woman should book an ayahuasca ceremony with Leonard or this agency. Either they're complicit in this or they're being negligent in vetting shamans. Either way, they're not to be trusted to administer ayahuasca to a woman. What happened to me is not something I want to talk about but I feel like it is my responsibility to tell women about what happened to me so that they can avoid it. And if for whatever reason they end up where I was, then have some sort of strategy to get themselves out.

931,Unwanted sexual advances during ceremony arranged by Manaus Jungle Tours / Amazing Tours Agency,lavransson,"> My question to you though is, if you were me, how would you have gone about finding ""trusted people""?

Well, I can't second guess you. You got a personal reference, you did some research, the place has hundreds of good reviews, it all looked legit. It probably would have worked out fine 9 out of 10 times. And I get that you are traveling and trying to be adventuresome, etc. I really like your carefree attitude and perspective, actually. I think some people would have been really traumatized by what you experienced, but you move right on.

I guess I'm a just a bit more cautious with ayahuasca. It is so powerful and I believe one should seek out a shaman with great care and diligence. Maybe this is because I've read so many negative accounts of incompetent shamans who can't hold it together for people who have challenging experiences and need a steady presence from an experienced shaman. Not to mention the molester shamans (although I'm a guy so that's one less thing I need to worry about).

The first place I went to in South America had 80+ good reviews and they are a dedicated ayahuasca center. Those places may cost more but I think it's worth it. Nonetheless, as I wrote earlier, even some of the top places sometimes wind up with a rogue shaman, so there's no guarantees.

So I got a bit lucky, as my first shaman is excellent. He referred me to a US-based shaman (near where I live in the US) who he trained with, and those are the only two that I've seen. I've had an itch to try other shamans, but I almost feel like I don't want to take a chance on others unless I am really sure. I've had some very powerful and vulnerable experiences with both, and I trust them, and that means a lot to me. But to each, his or her own.

On the other hand, many people prefer to try a more off the grid ""local shaman"" for a more authentic experience. If that's what you're seeking, then you just need to do more on-the-ground research and getting to know people. I'm not able to do that, so I go through the retreat.

> Are you sure? Or are you just guessing? Shaman-to-participant sexual assault does not occur at reputable centers because ceremonies are held in group settings. The group setting is a basic qualifier you should include when doing research.

I actually wrote my post after reading this whole thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/Ayahuasca/comments/2u594k/warning_baris_betsa_owned_by_guillermo_ar%C3%A9valo_is/

This post in particular stood out to me: ""Nobody sees him in the dark, chanting to women, touching them. People automatically put their trust in him as he is the healer, so people don't question his actions, people praise him for his healing abilities and he is a very powerful healer, and with this power he abuses his trust. The women never question the abuse, they blame themselves for not being able to say no, and never question or stand up for themselves. IT HAPPENED TO ME, in the dark, his hands under my clothes, up my shirt, down my pants, trying to kiss my lips. These allegations and abuses are very real. After this I never drank ayahuasca again.""

I think it's naive to think that this stuff doesn't happen with reputable shamans. And in my case, as I said in my post, there were people around at first. He got me alone right after my second dose when I wasn't thinking as clearly. When I think back on it, it seemed very premeditated on his part.

> Hooray for research.

I think you could give me a bit of a break. I had a personal recommendation from someone, a very recent positive review for ayahuasca on the tour's TripAdvisor page plus a certificate of excellence for the agency from the boatload of good reviews. And I also spoke with Leonard over the phone for a while. He also insisted that this was the only shaman he trusts with his clients. I definitely should've done more due diligence and I know what I did was risky but it's not like I just trust him on blind faith alone.

But none of that changes the fact that the shaman and the agency also share part of the blame and that a crime was committed against *me*, not the other way around. The shaman obviously is a creep. And I very clearly signed up and paid for the ayahuasca ceremony that was on the agency's website and they didn't deliver that. After all that Leonard said to me about how trustworthy his shaman is, why isn't he answering his phone now? He was very responsive until when I felt in danger with the shaman and tried to call him.

951,Unwanted sexual advances during ceremony arranged by Manaus Jungle Tours / Amazing Tours Agency,femaletraveler2016,"redditatt, I agree that we're at times so afraid of 'blaming the victim' that we often neglect to question the victim. And that has serious consequences for the accused. We've seen that play out in certain high profile cases recently and it sucks (ala Columbia mattress case). 

However, I think there are ways to question the accuser without blaming her/him for what allegedly happened. For the record, I didn't down vote any of your posts but I think you could've avoided being so unpopular if you didn't immediately chastise and belittle me. You put the fault squarely on me by saying that it was my lack of research and poor decisions that are to blame and that I 'just shouldn't have put [myself] in the situation to begin with.' Then you accused me of putting his company at risk, citing the 'overwhelmingly positive' reviews on TripAdvisor as an indicator that he's running a 'successful business' and why you're 'sure he would be interested in dealing with this matter' (ironically, these are the same reviews that I used as the basis of my 'poor research'). Turns out he wasn't interested but you assumed for some reason that he would be and that I had just not bothered to try. You assumed the best of him and the worst of me. But I'm glad you tried to see things from Leonard's perspective and that you asked this important question.

You also had every right to call me out on my actions but if I'm responsible for my poor decision making, then I don't know why you wouldn't call Leonard out. He should also be responsible for his poor judgement too considering that he was one that sent me to this Shaman and it was his driver who picked me up from my hostel and brought me to the man's house. And then he was the one that convinced me to stay when I called him after arriving at the shaman's house. All of these details were in my original post and yet in your first response, you only criticized and disparaged my actions. I think you could've play devil's advocate without being as insulting and accusatory towards me. I don't think it's a good way to start a dialogue, though I did try to respond as respectfully as I could and I'm glad that our discussion helped provide more details to make my review more thorough. 

TL;DR I think there are ways to respectfully examine both the accuser's and the accused's sides of the story so that we can create an environment that doesn't shame/scare victims into hiding abuse but also takes into account that people are innocent until proven guilty.

955,Be careful who you sit with,TheHappySloth,"Personally, I think there is a ton of gate keeping going on in the aya community. I understand why but at the same time I wager that 90% of the healing going on is via the medicine and the taker. Keep in mind I say this as someone who brews and mainly drinks alone. The facilitator and group you drink with can certainly impact your ceremony. I'm not denying that, but I think if you have prepared well for your ceremony, you shouldn't have to be reliant on their vibes or help.

There are certainly interactions to be mindful of and to make sure pupils don't take. There is prep work that should be done by the taker and the facilitator should be the one to ensure that they understand the importance as a fail safe. But once again, when it comes down to the core of it, it's mother aya and the pupil doing most of the work.

I think the thing that irks me the most is this thought of ""you need a lineage"" that permeates the community. To many, it's not an authentic experience unless you have a shipbibo shaman conducting the ceremony. I've been healed in miraculous ways and I don't have a lineage. Does that somehow make my healing less worthwhile than that which comes from facilitators that have a lineage?

I've taken San Pedro with an Ayahuasca practitioner, but she had pretty bad vibes, and I ended up spinning out a bit. I'd rather take it in a legit ceremony or with a church, out in the desert.

There's nothing historically ritualized with LSD, so I take it with respect, but there's no ritualized structure around it.

It's cool taking something on your own, there are many lessons in that, or hanging out with friends, at a music festival, but there's definitely something different about somebody creating and holding a safe space for you, with intentions of helping and guiding you. It's not better or worse, but it's more in alignment with __me__, at this point in time with my healing. It brings another, different human dimension into my personal connection with the plants/fungi.

For the people who say ""hey, be your own shaman and do it on your own"", I get it. Maybe I'll eventually do Ayahuasca, or Psilocybin again on my own, with the way I approach them with a practitioner and with similar intentions, but I'd also like to suggest to them to try doing it with an experienced shaman/practitioner eventually who is working in integrity as they also might learn some stuff.",0,2,eixte3f,t3_b2zp20,t1_eiwyh0n,/r/Ayahuasca/comments/b2zp20/be_careful_who_you_sit_with/eixte3f/

I personally wouldn't use the more hardcore psychoactives in public spaces like festivals and parties. Too much weird shit can happen (it usually does when tripping in public :D) and we are more sensitive energetically to our surroundings when under the influence.  
That being said, i think at lower doses, cannabis, psilocybin and mescaline can safely ad positively to many experiences (except mathematics lol!) without the need for a spotter.  
I would dial back the intensity considerably for festivals and parties.

>**The leaves of P. incarnata have been reported variously to give 0.005%, 0.12 mg%, and nil, of harman alkaloids**

Compared to Syrian rue which can be 6%+ harmala alkaloids by weight:

>Harmine, 0.44%[97]–1.84%[96]–4.3%

>Harmaline, 0.25%[96]–0.79%[97]–5.6%

>Total harmala alkaloids were at least 5.9% of dried weight, in one study.

Anyways passion flower is still awesome, but you'd need to consume a ton for it to have solid MAOI effects. That said it could still enhance experiences in other ways.

Side note, Tobacco also contains harman and other harmala alkaloids. And the more traditional varieties used by shamans not only have much more nicotine but much more of the MAOI's.

There are at least two kinds of awareness. One is focal and one is peripheral. The brain processes focal and peripheral sensations in different part of the brain, so it is possible to engage both. They will be distinct experiences. 

For example, you can look at something in front of you. Then try to see something out of the corner of your eyes without moving your head or your eyes. That is peripheral awareness. Notice how, with the peripheral, you can be aware of your periphery all at once. 

Try flipping between the focal and the peripheral, then see if you can do both.

I mean it in a pretty concrete way. Lifeforms eat and get eaten, receiving and giving actual life force without blockages. It's the logical and free-flowing way of things, a kind of basic contract among living things that doesn't need to be questioned or complicated.

> I however am absolutely certain that to survive in nature is a struggle & to sleep in the cold on an empty stomach is suffering.

The suffering I refer to is according to at least the Buddhist usage of the term, if one wants to give it meaning besides as an extra synonym for pain. It's a profound non-acceptance of things as they are, in a way that causes further underlying long-term hurting besides the immediate sensations that would simply come and go. I just recently wrote this elsewhere:

> The universe can be thought of as a singular beautiful process that unfolds in love-filled ways when you learn to see it. Just like a human is a process where countless cells have different roles, some of them ""worse"" than others but still making the process whole and possible.

> Pain is an evolutionarily developed reaction for one's own good; suffering is taking a self-hurting attitude toward pain and pleasure and attachments and aversions and the truth of how the world is. The former is inevitable while the latter is optional although very popular.

As for the lack of struggle, I refer to nature and its components accepting themselves and their truth of existence how they are, not wasting energy to make it different against all odds and nature's necessary mechanisms. The only dramatic and ethical tension in nature is the one created by the mind of an unaccepting human observer that likes to extend human social sensibilities to things that are not human.

I haven't needed ayahuasca to start thinking and feeling this way. Eastern philosophies, meditation and Alan Watts had things to do with it.

Love can be understood as an underlying universal feeling or idea or framework instead of just an individual relation or emotion between objects and subjects. A free and natural flow of energy is one aspect that would describe it well.",0,1,edxsc0u,t3_aafxkg,t1_edxmdkz,/r/Ayahuasca/comments/aafxkg/love_explained_by_machine_elves_the_most/edxsc0u/

1096,"Why I Quit Ayahuasca Shamanism After 11 Years and 1,000 Ceremonies",KindaGamey,"I had the same experience with 'enlightenment.' I couldn't even say the G-word at first (God), but I started absorbing a lot of Eckhart Tolle and other masters and meditating and eventually I thought I was transformed.

But in doing that I lost my humanity because I was trying to be MORE than human. I lost the ability to pick a side which means I lost the ability to ACT because I was just an observer. Every probability was ok because bad situations were just methods for creating friction towards good. So what's to fight against? Even death was no longer a deterrent or a scary endgame result even if all of humanity perished at the hands of some disaster or other. We'd just dust off and start again. Nothing is lost.

And what's the point of being enlightened if you can't help anyone else up the ladder? I didn't relate to other human beings. In gaining personal mastery I lost touch with all of my ""flaws"" that made other people feel comfortable around me and made them feel better about themselves. Flaws and personal mistakes and personality traits and strong opinions right or wrong -- these are a tapestry of choices that paint a picture, and that flawed picture is more beautiful and intriguing than a perfect staged and framed portrait. I can be socially awkward, forgetful, even dumb, and that's fantastic. 

So I went back to alcohol and weed and picked some sides and put myself back together -- not the me that was above being human, but the truly human me. I'll save enlightenment for when we can all climb the ladder. Till then I'm just gonna be me and wink at you from behind my eyes, or turn a phrase to make you question or suss out who has a flash of recognition. I'm not going to try and tell nobody nothing they don't want to hear. If you're not ready you won't hear it anyway. And my perspective is not a one-size-fits-all coat that anyone can wear anyway. It takes many different types of pieces to make a functional machine. There is no one way.

1153,"After ayahuasca, I realized my marriage was over",tsukato2017,"Nice story. I have a wife I can't stand, and although I've done aya numerous times, I didn't need it to tell me my marriage sucks. I too have kids, so I would've already split, if it weren't for them. I think I've found an easier way than divorce, to get free. She has become busy with businesses here in Thailand. We have a company as well in china. Anyway, I'm going to expand our business into Ecuador, which she could never tolerate, being Chinese, and I will take the kids for the ""experience"" which she'd never fight cuz the kids are a burden to her.
I think marriage is an unnatural association for humans. Who'd sign a lifetime contract for employment, a house, or a car?
In this situation, she visits the kids twice a year for a while, and being legally married keeps me away from becoming stupid, and entering any long term relationships. And someday, she'll find some idiot that loves her, she'll want the divorce, and I'll have the upper hand with my money and kids.

Also, it should not involve any money. These gringos all eager to go Peru to these “spiritual” shamen rituals in fancy expensive retreats is a travesty.

You want to understand Ayahuasca, go to its origins: go to Mestre Irineu’s church in Rio Branco, Brazil, or go to any UDV center.  Two different paths, but both truthful in their origins and both honoring the spiritual determination not to profit from it.

I intend to go to Ceu do Montreal at some point, but, it's a 6 hour drive for a 4-6 hour ceremony.  I don't feel like ceremonies where you have to pay is disrespectful, as long as the money involved isn't excessive and is a just compensation for the effort required to make the ceremony happen.  I think the people and their intentions are where the respect or disrespect comes from.  I've certainly find that I get out in proportion to what I put in.

1201,Santo Daime Church - Céu do Vale,sbound888,"It's a connection now that I am able to connect with, during meditation and at times when I am more in flow state, more present then I see or hear a deeper meaning.

But the relationship is mine to have or not have.

I still personally have hangups about the fact I have spiritual guides, it's rather amusing.  One part of my brain wants to deny it still (my old belief) yet in the end my life experiences now have had me experience something beyond that belief.

So it's more a process of my own comfort in accepting and not judging myself the same way I used to judge others that had guides.

When I was younger I was ready to kill myself and walk out in front of a car.  The only thing that stopped me was a voice I heard and a total feeling of calmness wash over me.

When I conciously met one of my guides I had exactly the same feeling wash over me and I thought.... Shit I know who you are, you were with me back then even if I didn't understand it.

I then sea 2 other pivotal decisions I had made in life also through guidance, that at the time I had no idea why I made the decision, everything logically made sense to make a different one.  But I ""knew"" the right choice was the one I made even if I didn't know why.

I have taken it several times , 10 times and have unlocked unwrapped many layers.  Who I am has evolved and still does constantly.

I'm now doing concious integration without having to run to mother Ayahuasca to unwrap it for me.

Before I couldn't unwrap or integrate my life experiences and get to deeper understanding around past, changing what it meant to me and being at peace with it.... Without ayahuasca.

That has changed dramatically.

I'm a growth strategist for digital marketing, yes I lead people and teams and also need to focus in.  Have hired many engineers actually because they think differently and are highly analytical.  Large cross over which makes them well suited to certain digital marketing functions.

Keep the journey and just have an open mind to what could show up.

Then see what parts fit with your world view and what don't.

If you find your world view is no longer serving your evolution forward than be curious about where you adopted that view from and work on one that supports you.

I mean really..... How many of our own beliefs did we actually choose?  For most of us very little were concious choices.  Our environment and collective experience shaped us.

Taking back ownership of this vessel and being curious enough to challenge our own steadfast beliefs is an uncomfortable process yet highly rewarding.

Just after smoking DMT and breaking through 3 times over 3 days I was severely depressed and suicidal for months, quit my job, broke up with my girlfriend, became estranged with every single family member and friend, let my house go and ended up sleeping in my car for a while until I managed to pull out of it.      
I still think Ayuhuasca and smokable DMT are miracle substances with immensely positive uses but it’s not for everyone and people like me with disturbing pasts and chronic depression are better off treating with mushrooms and less abrupt medical alternatives.

1205,Ayahuasca retreat suicides - We need to do better,lavransson,"/u/NicaraguaNova, thanks, I watched it all the way through (14:11). I like what you have to say.

Indeed there does seem to be a Wild West atmosphere at these retreats. While I would hate to over-regulate and sterilize these retreats and bleach the sparkle out of them, maybe sunlight can be the best disinfectant. We need more reviews, more accountability, more transparency, somehow.

Also I like what you had to say about the way ayahuasca is sometimes over-venerated like a cult and anyone who doesn't experience rainbows and sunshine with **The Mother** is a failure and is at fault for not surrendering, for resisting, for being weak, or for being closed-minded. Sometimes any criticism is itself criticized because we shouldn't bring negative attention to ayahuasca; reminds me of how the Roman Catholic Church hid its own sins for public relations reasons.

Your account of the woman participant at a retreat who was struggling yet walking around with a forced smile as if to will herself into happy-happy-joy-joy made me sad, because I've seen that too, the pressure to say you've had an amazing ceremony because so many others are saying that, and feeling like you're a failed human if you don't. I recall reading a few threads here from people who came back from ayahuasca who *didn't* have a good experience (not bad, but not good), yet see others who did have a good experience, and feel like failures by comparison. Not only did they spend a lot of money to go there, and take time out of their lives, and stir up an internal whirlwind, but they go back home dejected because their huge expectations failed to manifest and they beat themselves up for not being good enough.

As for me, I believe ayahuasca has been good for me (4 years on) but I don't take personal pride in that. I think some people might have the right temperament that can respond well to ayahuasca, and other people are built differently and ayahuasca might not work for them. I also think I simply had a bit of luck.

Only nitpick I might offer is that you have to be careful about drawing too many conclusions from two suicides. 2 is not much of a sample size to draw any statistical relevant conclusions (and to be fair, you did point that out a bit at the end). Suicide occurs everywhere, and almost by definition, the ayahuasca scene draws people who might be predisposed to suicide. The tragic individual at Rainbow, by some accounts, was already deeply troubled even before he arrived at the center, so it feels unfair to *overly* conflate ayahuasca centers with this person's suicide.",1,10,ekvec53,t3_bd1avb,t3_bd1avb,/r/Ayahuasca/comments/bd1avb/ayahuasca_retreat_suicides_we_need_to_do_better/ekvec53/
1206,Ayahuasca retreat suicides - We need to do better,littleseal777,"Thank you for sharing this. I haven’t had the chance to watch the video yet but thank you for addressing this topic. We need to do better. For me a big thing is a lot of ayahuasca spaces are not trauma informed and many people doing this work, even the shamans at times, are not able to hold space for people’s traumas and truth. There is so much spiritual bypassing and pressure to seem grateful and happy, and I have felt this pressure myself. I work very very well with ayahuasca. For me the problem was never ayahuasca but the people I was around. These people who were facilitating and running and holding ceremonies, including the head shaman, had not done basic work on themselves to be able to really hold space and respect others and their traumas. These people are not bad people and they did help me a lot and I saw them help many others, but it was a huge mixed bag and I saw many people leave feeling scarred by their experiences too. It was and is totally not okay. I can think of many instances where the behaviour of the people I was around triggered me or was abusive enough to trigger suicidal ideation within me. There was one specific month in the jungle that really stands out to me with this. I have a lot of heavy trauma and no one was able to be present with my experiences. Maybe one time. But beyond that I was around people who were running ceremonies and also telling me that everything happens for a reason, including rape. There was just emptiness and hollow spiritual epitaphs instead of compassion. My experiences with ayahuasca herself were incredibly life saving so I don’t regret anything, but this month especially I truly understood why people have committed suicide at retreats. 

There are other issues too, one thing I learned very recently is that the shaman and their energy has a huge effect on the ceremonies. If a shaman isn’t working on themselves and if they don’t have integrity that energy will be in the ceremony and can have huge consequences for those in the ceremony.  

I think the main thing is people are hiding from the truth, and really no one not even ayahuasca can do this work for us. I have been doing this for almost 4 years and I have seen people who have done like 500 ceremonies who are still fragmented and sometimes abusive people. I have seen this in shamans also. 

Anyone who wants to be a shaman, apprentice, facilitate, run a retreat centre, needs to be really honest with themselves, especially about the shadow aspects of why they are doing this. We need to be honest about where we are using spirituality as an opium for the masses instead of a true path. We also really need to be aware that there is an energetic false light that tricks many people and because of this grounded integrity is incredibly important.

See how the people around you treat and speak of those who they don’t look up to. How do they treat women and girls? If they are white how do they treat and see people of colour, especially women and girls of colour? Are they homophobic and transphobic ? Are there lines being blurred with flirting and romantic and sexual interest? The biggest sign that things were not okay with my group was that in many ways they could not empathize with the local teenage girls in the jungle and this includes the other white women I was with, not just the men. 

I dunno people need to get back into their bodies and start being real. My therapist told me I had the worst case of secondary trauma from my time with a specific ayahuasca group. Again ayahuasca really did help me despite all this, but ultimately it’s not ok for anyone to be so traumatized when they are trying to get help. I know my experience is something many others experience with other groups too.",1,7,ekw4cry,t3_bd1avb,t3_bd1avb,/r/Ayahuasca/comments/bd1avb/ayahuasca_retreat_suicides_we_need_to_do_better/ekw4cry/

Please please please be careful everyone and remember that Ayahuasca will NOT fix all of your problems... in fact, they might make them worse! 

I say all of this with having experienced 3 ceremonies with a family healer in a garage in Peru. It was actually incredibly healing and the Shaman was wonderful but the way it was set up and the medicine we used one of the times wasn't great.

1228,Ayahuasca retreat suicides - We need to do better,BlueGrayTurquoise,"Smoking DMT didn’t make me suicidal. I hope I didn’t suggest that. It was my inability to deal with the things I confronted on DMT about things in my past, and being completely convinced this life wasn’t real and just a placeholder or an interface until I crossed over, permanently, to the other side. I’m full of guilt and regret, and I’ve lived with the ability to hold those things back and rationalize them into feelings I could manage. But, that all fell apart after smoking DMT. I don’t blame DMT for me suddenly quit my job or isolating from anyone, DMT didn’t change my personality, I just wasn’t ready such an intense, personal, and gutting experience.     
    
What I hope to get across is that I’m not the norm. I obviously have old psychological issues. I either needed more time meditating with mushrooms and eased into higher doses over a year to be prepared for DMT or I needed to stay away from it altogether. I smoked around Halloween last year and to this day in mid April I still think about breaking through every single night I lay in bed.     
I’ve ultimately turned out fine and re-established my relationships and made new ones, and I’m happy today, but, and I hate saying this, but I just know I would’ve been so much better off keeping with mushrooms and sorting myself out piece by piece to become the open and self aware person I am today - and I’d still have a great job lol.

Back to your original point i totally agree that people should be able to end their life how they choose. I live in Switzerland where the right to die is completely legal and is part of the culture, so I am a big advocate for people to have sovereignty over their own existence.

That said stabbing yourself to death with a kitchen knife (as in this case), doesn't seem like a calm rational decision about ones existence.

1260,My friend and I made a subreddit for people struggling with integration/questions about ayahuasca and other psychedelics.,much2myamusement,"Hello, winged mongoose.  Sounds like you've got some real wisdom going on there (nice how projection works both ways isn't it).   So I came here hoping for a little advice on where to find the best incense and wreathing supplies and instead found...  well you know the ayahuasca subreddit.  So yeah, your new subreddit is more than timely.  

What needs to happen is a big and comprehensive, but very concise, sticky.  And it should go up on both boards.  There's just no way to help all these people otherwise, and their numbers are almost certainly increasing.  

I'd already told a person in one thread that I'd try to put a basic model of human psychology and healing in writing within the next month or so in order to help them find their way towards and through their own agonizing misery (shhhhh, I haven't told them that's what happens yet), and then everytime I come here there are two new threads started by people with the same issues.  And many of them seem to be pretty far from the level of understanding of what they're going through that they'll need in order to get through it with the least possible confusion, resistance, and resultant suffering.

My own night started about thirteen years ago.  I've really charged it pretty hard, and it's just starting to look like it's reasonably close to wrapping up.  At least it's at a level where so little bothers me that my remaining fears mostly consist of literal monsters, and grievous bodily harm, like catastrophic head injury, paralysis and CTE.  Getting the  exposure necessary to extinguish these fears should be... idk, but I was told to go through them so that I'll have the ability to do a particular job, and told pretty convincingly, and repeatedly, so what the hell, why not.  I already know what's on the other side of fear, so why not just wrap up the rest of it?

I'm somewhat psychic.  But I'm very skeptical.  On the phenomena to which I could assign numbers and calculate for p, I calculated the probability of me being delusional to twelve zeros (before I was advised to stop),  specifically p = 0.000000000000222.  Of course most psychic activity can't be nailed down numerically, but where it could I only included in the calculation of p phenomena where I could honestly say that I would have guessed the opposite.  

That was last summer and early fall though.  Psychic ability seems to bubble as markets do, only to crash and then rise again.  I found a passage in the Pathwork Lectures that describes this pattern, though I'd already seen it occur by then, without having recognized it.

Anyhow, I mention my presently shoddy psychic capacity because I was recently - not long before I came to this forum - told that I should be a guide, or facilitator, or something, for people taking ayahuasca.  But it wasn't clear, and still isn't, in what context that should occur.  It looked like I was supposed to actually give people Aya, but for all I know in my current state, it could just be helping people here on Reddit.

So, if you'd like any help writing the reasonably brief yet still comprehensive explaination of psychology and healing that a  great many of these people are quite in need of, I could help with that.  This is my field.  It's all I've really done for about 14 years, and I went pretty hard at it, and still do, so I'm quite knowledgeable.

Did I just volunteer you for a writing assignment?  Perhaps I'll manage it myself if you don't want to help, or perhaps aren't the person for the job.  But more than one person needs to recognize the need for it, and to advocate for it being done.  You and your friend may well.  That would make three.

Understanding is so key to progress as unless one understands how this process works they either won't know how to progress efficiently, or not really understanding what's possible if they were to take the necessary steps, they won't have the motivation to take them.  

Understanding is what it's come down to for me.  A comprehensive understanding isn't just necessary in order to know how to succeed, it's necessary in order to have the motivation necessary to work towards that possible success.  The more complete my own understanding of life has become the more my motivation - and therefore work ethic - have improved.  

Or... fuck it, lol.  Let me know what you think about this ""sticky"" idea.  And please say you hate it, lol.",0,2,elclrmv,t3_beebfb,t3_beebfb,/r/Ayahuasca/comments/beebfb/my_friend_and_i_made_a_subreddit_for_people/elclrmv/

1264,My friend and I made a subreddit for people struggling with integration/questions about ayahuasca and other psychedelics.,wingedmongoose,"Integration is any of the work that is done in the months following an ayahuasca experience, after you’ve returned home to your culture, your life, your people...back to the humdrum I guess. It is the way your life changes—upheavel, transformation—following such an event. For me, it was the little understood [“Dark Night of the Soul”](https://www.mctb.org/mctb2/table-of-contents/part-iv-insight/30-the-progress-of-insight/5-dissolution-entrance-to-the-dark-night/) phenomenon (stages 5-9 in that map), and it was *brutal.* Spiritual awakening for me has looked a lot like a psychotic breakdown and rebuilding. I had an extreme dark night—constant suicidal ideation, anxiety, hysterical crying, seeing...seeing things that I did not have the ability to see before. I eventually found the resources to move beyond this, and I am now in a better place than I ever have been, but the dark night is real and I wish more people knew about it in the West! It would save people and their loved ones a lot of needless suffering!

You gave yourself in, and you received blessings back. It is true, everything is okay in the bigger picture, pain is part of life, but suffering is optional, we are connected to everything and everyone, the Universe really is amazingly beautiful, and we are an intrinsic part of this cosmic dance.

What you described in your third night is called an ego death. We are under the illusion that we are separated from the external world, that beyond our skin the world is not us, but it is also. If we were removed from our environment, we'd die. You left your human persona and your human mind, and went to another point in time and space, which is also you, which is also the Universe expressing itself. And everything was alright. Being a rock in space is alright, being a human on Earth is alright, just float, just flow, just be <3

1- I wanted to know where I can find more reviews about the Ayahuasca Foundation. I would think that given the number of years this place has been operating many more reviews would have been posted on in the online reviews, Facebook, Reddit, and the Ayahuasca Forum site. I have noticed you are here and in the Ayahuasca forum. I don't know if that's deterring people from expressing their expeiriences. It makes me wonder what is being hidden from those seeking more information and if that's why so many services are provided in the retreats, for example, the 2 weeks for a lower cost than places like the Temple to the Way of Light. 

2- why is the person in this link below saying not to trust Enrique Lopez who is one of your Shipibo curanderos?  https://www.reddit.com/r/Ayahuasca/comments/4av1wp/ayahuasca_you_can_too_pt_2/

This is certainly confusing, as the term 'study' gets thrown around a lot.  Some people will say they've been studying for five years because they've been to Peru a few times over the course of five years.  When it comes to being qualified, however, it really comes down to characteristics that are far beyond study - like compassion, sensitivity, intuition, etc.  There really is no way to know for sure (the same for indigenous curanderos as well) so we have to trust our own instincts, how we feel about the person, and to some degree what other people say about that person.  The same can be said about nearly any profession: doctor, lawyer, mechanic, plumber, contractor, painter, nanny, designer, etc.  You just do the best you can and trust your own feelings and intuition.
2. I definitely think anyone serving ayahuasca should be required to disclose the ingredients of the brew, as well as who made it and where and when.
3. It's not the easiest thing to describe, but a simple way might be to consider energy lines that reach out of a person's field and connect them to other beings, memories, experiences, places, etc.  Sometimes these lines get crossed and caused shortages, or explosions, or blockages.  By 'straightening' or cleaning the lines, the energy can flow smoothly again.

Over a period of time that was actually not that long ago in our history, shamanism was exterminated in many places on the planet.  Shamans (or witches) were hunted down and persecuted.  This coincided with the realization and subsequent rejection of the oppression of religious organizations, and the birth of modern science.  Science has now reached a point where spirit can be understood again but in the relatively short period of time in between humans managed to destroy the environment and cause a lot of problems.  Returning spirit to the core of our identities, to me, would definitely help us as a species, and a planet.

Most indigenous curanderos know how to do brujeria on some level, but don't act like that very often.  It's not easy to identify by particular traits.  It's more about feeling and intuition, unless, of course, they have performed brujeria on you or someone you know and trust.  It is a very complicated topic, however, as it is not uncommon to project onto someone the idea that he/she has done brujeria.  I think what is probably a better idea would be to just work on your own personal protection.  It is not unlike our lives in the modern world.

In regards to financial aid, we are currently working to create a fund for that, but we won't be able to offer to many people each year.

1395,"I've lived in the Amazon since 2004, working and studying with indigenous shaman and ayahuasca. Ask me anything!",tannercarlos,"If there will be facilitators for the ceremony (hopefully there will be) then you should let them know about your sensitivities, or speak to the curandero (or person leading the ceremony).  I also recommend talking to them about your anxiety, just so they know and perhaps they can offer some further advice.  
As for what advice I can offer, I do think that letting go is a good mantra, but I think an even better one is to trust the process.  It may be difficult and challenging at times, but it is a process.  One thing I can recommend is doing some vapor baths or saunas on the days leading up to the ceremony.  We use vapor baths a lot on our retreats and courses and find they have tremendous benefit.  Also, don't be afraid to ask for help.  The ceremony facilitators should be ready to assist anyone who needs help, and they should be able to perform some techniques or use methods to help calm you down should you get too anxious.  I think the more comfortable you feel with the people you'll be with the better, so I also recommend getting to know the people sitting in ceremony with you as well as and especially the people running the ceremony.  Knowing that you'll be well looked after will help you.  
I wish you infinite blessings on your journey.  Feel free to post again about your experience.  I'd love to hear how it goes.  Remember, one ceremony is often not enough, so don't be discouraged if not a lot happens in the ceremony or you don't feel a dramatic change afterwards.  The programs we offer in Peru involve a lot more than just ayahuasca ceremonies, with vapor baths, purgatives, nervous system, blood, and respiratory system cleanses, and remedies to boost immune system response and oxigenation of the blood.  In the jungle, ayahuasca is just one component of treatment.  There are numerous other components.  The most important component of all, in my opinion, is your own consciousness.  Meditating on your reasons for doing the ceremony and trying to discover the roots of that reasoning is a great idea.  Those insights could provide very beneficial information and/or feelings going into the ceremony and beyond.  Good luck!

1396,"I've lived in the Amazon since 2004, working and studying with indigenous shaman and ayahuasca. Ask me anything!",tannercarlos,"I'm not sure if there is a difference based on location, but I definitely think that there is a big difference in treatment.  Often times, outside of the Amazon rainforest, only ceremonies are held, and I think that has created a false idea that ayahuasca is the only medicine used by the indigenous people, or that it is the medicine for all ailments.  The truth is that there are a wide variety of plant medicines and treatment methods, and while ayahuasca forms the heart of the healing traditions of the Amazon, the other plants and plant preparations employed are incredible contributions to the healing process and can sometimes play a bigger role in the treatment than the ayahuasca.  I would love for the whole of the healing science of curanderismo to spread along with ayahuasca and for the local plants in every region to again become known for their medicinal value, but I am very glad that ayahuasca has and continues to spread all over the globe.  I think that real benefit can be achieved just attending ceremonies, but I know that the benefit possible would be greatly increased if other plants and plant remedies were included in the treatment process.  For example, in our programs we use vapor baths as a treatment and they are incredibly powerful in reducing anxiety, releasing traumas, and physically removing toxins.  That is just one example of the many plant treatments that are used in conjunction with ayahuasca in the Amazon that are not typically found outside of this area.
I've included a link to the seven major components of healing within the Shipibo tradition.  I hope it helps.

   Hope you're doing well.  Sorry for the late reply.  I don't get on Reddit very often.  Thanks for writing.  If you are looking for reviews, there are over a hundred video testimonials on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMhs4h2WMbYZ1_d58I4j8Dw and there are also some reviews on facebook, google+, ayaadvisors, retreatguru, and some other sites.  I do get the feeling that you have a negative impression of our organization, but perhaps watching those video reviews will give you a different perception. In regards to Dan's post that you provided a link to, thank you for bringing that to my attention.  I like Dan and I hope he is doing well.  He did seem to get it into his head that there was dark energies at work and seemed to project them onto don Enrique, but unfortunately he did not know enough Shipibo to understand the icaros and really just starting creating stories that his own mind would confirm.  He never worked for the AF or even volunteered for us, but he did complete one of our courses and even left a review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=259_o64UvUE Unfortunately, he clearly has a negative impression of his former teacher, and possibly of me as well.  Regardless, I wish him well in all of his endeavors.
When it comes to the health and safety of our program participants, we take the utmost care to ensure that they receive optimal treatment and always strive to achieve the highest results for each person.  While we do have emergency transportation available if should ever be needed, having had over a thousand participants we have always managed to handle any and all situations ourselves, thanks to the high level of training our staff has, and the incredible knowledge and ability of our curanderos.  
Hope that helps answer your questions.  Feel free to contact me again with any other questions or concerns.  Again, my apologies for the late reply.  I'll try to get on Reddit more often in the future.  I hope you're doing well...

1398,"I've lived in the Amazon since 2004, working and studying with indigenous shaman and ayahuasca. Ask me anything!",tannercarlos,"I'm from New England and I was brought up a typical american, I guess.  I ate lucky charms, brought pb&j to public school, watched the A-team, played Atari and Nintendo, and ended up going to UMass, where I graduated with degrees in art and philosophy.  I went on to become the production manager of a newspaper before coming down to Peru.  
I actually mentioned cultural appropriation in a previous answer, stating that I'd never heard of someone referencing cultural appropriation when an indigenous person becomes a lawyer or learns how to play the guitar, or does or adopts aspects that are clearly not from his/her culture.  It seems that cultural appropriation is a bit one-sided, in my opinion.  I think the impact of ayahuasca tourism has certainly influenced the changes taking place within the traditional practice, a practice that has been changing since it began.  The indigenous tradition has never stayed the same.  It has always been in a state of development, adapting to the changes of the environment and needs of the culture.  However, the rate of development was relatively slow in the distant past, speeding up as changes occurred that required adaptation, namely the spanish invasion and now the increase in westernization.  Just like science, I feel that the tradition is improving with the new developments, and it will continue to develop as it is learned by people from all over the world and spread to distant locations, environments, and cultures.  On a personal note, I lived with my first teacher for four years, and when I moved in he was dirt poor (like the floor was literally dirt) and his kids didn't want to be curanderos, because they didn't want to be poor.  But, thanks to foreigners traveling to Peru to receive treatment from him, he was able to live more comfortably, and now there's a good chance that at least one of his children will continue his ancestral traditions and become a healer.  I honestly think that without ayahuasca tourism, the westernization of the Amazon that is unavoidable would have resulted in shamanism dying out, just as it did in nearly every other culture around the world.  Thankfully, humans are gaining new perspectives and coming to realize that the indigenous people of the world understand a wisdom that we lost and that it is very important to ensure that that wisdom be preserved and spread back into human culture.

Otherwise, lands (and therefore people) are sold out to companies for natural resources. The guy in the video was almost saying we shouldn't interfere at all as a tourist base.

I mean, this 'argument' of tourism changing small/rural communities that can probably be made for a large portion of Mexico (and hundreds of other places). Look at Tulum, for example.

And now Spanish element is part of the 'culture' you are embracing. 

Should we just all isolate? 

I mean, on one hand, it's okay for this guy to travel around the world and live/study abroad, but when less educated people travel to his homeland he's considering it derogatory? I find it a little hypocritical. What if an American argued that this guy moving to NYC to study was eroding our national traditions? He'd be considered a racist. Turing this whole talk around the other direction would sound kind of isolationist and racist.

Really. Thank you for sharing your experience. 

Do you feel like the substance had an intelligent sentience to it, or did you struggle to make sense of anything it showed you? It occurred to me that people who work with ayahuasca--brewing it in the traditional way--have a hand in every step of its preparation, from seed to tea. They sing and perform various ceremonial magick rituals to invite the spirit into the vine and to make a hospitable space for it. If this is not done, or not done as effectively,  then the presence of the spirit in the tea does not come through as strongly, if at all. B caapi does not automatically have the spirit in it; it needs to be invited in. Ayahuasca acts as a translator of sorts for what the DMT shows you, otherwise the trip doesn't make a lot of sense. Based on your brief description, it sounds like it was just a DMT trip. I could be wrong, but the weird racing thoughts and mind fuckery sound more like DMT than ayahuasca. I have done DMT a few times between the two weekend retreats I have had in the hopes that I could get the same benefits from DMT as I did from ayahuasca. While I was entertained by pure DMT (its like a crazy rollercoaster ride, eh), I don't feel like its really useful in the way ayahuasca is. Its not even close.

1431,On the dangers of doing ayahuasca solo.,wingedmongoose,"That's funny. (not the 'haha' kind of funny) I seriously wanted to do it alone because I did not have enough money to afford even the most basic retreat. So I bought stuff to brew it, but before it arrived, she visited me via intuition and told me not to do it alone, that it was a very BAD idea for me. Total opposite of what she told you...she even gave me the name of a retreat center to go to. Hell, I literally didn't even know what ayahuasca was and had never heard of it until it popped in my head one day when I was in an especially dark place. It's so funny how these things work. 

However, I think most people don't have such strong guidance; many struggle to reach that point of useful intuition within themselves. (This is not to say intuition is a 'special' power, *everyone* has it, but it is largely latent in most) So I think in the vast majority of cases, even if it seems to be 'okay,' it is really best to not pursue the solo route. At least for the first few times. Your intuition may very well be off. I know my intuition sometimes throws me a curveball regarding emotionally charged situations and its hard in that case to extract any useful guidance from it.

My Spirit Guides and Mother Ayahuasca were guiding me to drinking. Indeed, before drinking, I had a few experiences during meditation that almost seemed like deju vu ~ that this was a minor impression of Ayahuasca's power. Like I'd done it all before, in a past life.

I was resisting drinking for a while, but then Mother Ayahuasca had to be cruel-to-be-kind and threaten me with, essentially, ***drink me or die***. I have no idea what would have happened if I would have refused...

But I drank ~ first time, without DMT admixture. Second time, with. First time, it was like... Plato's Cave, and then, meeting my Guardian Spirit Guide. Second time... it began with two snakes circling up a miniature tree ~ almost like a bonsai tree. Mother Ayahuasca, as a snake, looks directly at me, and slithers into my head.

In over 50 ceremonies I have never had many of the experiences described, but some people around me have.  It's interesting how differently it can be experienced.

There are only a couple of bits of info/advice I disagree with there.

I don't usually purge, and many around me don't either.  Some people purge almost every time, but others rarely do.  It varies by individual.  Purging is in no way necessary to kick off the experience.

Regarding retreats vs. private ceremonies, I think they can be quite different experiences, but sharing a large room with others on the medicine can be a valuable experience and I certainly wouldn't try to push others away from having it.

1441,Everything I've learnt from 60+ Ayahuasca ceremonies,lavransson,"Thanks for posting this, Michael, a lot of good insights. In particular I like this:

>**TURN YOUR LESSONS INTO HABITS ASAP.** Listen to me: It doesn’t matter how inspired or motivated you feel after a ceremony, or how much you feel like a new person, you must turn your lessons into habits and implement what you’ve learnt ASAP, because the enthusiasm won’t last forever. As a shaman said to me: *“Think about your habits, you’ve done the same thing hundreds, if not thousands of times, and each time you’ve done the same thing, you’ve burnt a neural pathway into your brain. Ayahuasca has now burnt a new neural pathway into your brain, but it’s not as deep or as strong as your previous ones, so if you don’t reinforce it immediately, if you don’t use it, you’re going to lose it”*. That’s right. Ayahuasca gives you a window of opportunity within which to change a habit, but you must strike while the iron is hot and the inspiration is still there. If you don’t take action while you’re still feeling inspired and turn your lessons into habits within 2-5 days – one week tops, you’ll almost certainly go back to your old ways

As I look back at my own ayahuasca odyssey (20+ ceremonies with two Western shaman over 3.5 years), one aspect I've been focusing on is what you write above. What good (in the long run) is a profound ceremony if you don't put the lessons or inspiration into sustained action? (Well, even a profound ceremony in and of it self is plenty good...).

I think a lot of people have these amazing retreat experiences but later on some disillusionment or letdown can occur if you don't ""turn your lessons into habits and implement what you've learnt"", as you wrote. They say, ""I had all these light bulbs in ceremony, but here I am 3 months later and I'm right back where I started. Maybe even worse."" These anecdotes are backed by the limited amount of scientific research on ayahuasca and psychedelics, which often find that the rise in optimism fades for many people after around 6 months or so.

To me, I see it like this: ayahuasca gifts you some temporary superpowers. You can harness these superpowers to elevate your life to a higher level, a level that you might be able to sustain for a lasting period of time, even after the superpowers fade a bit. But if you don't lift yourself up, you'll enjoy the buzz of the superpowers but they will gradually dim and you may wind up close to where you started.

What are these superpowers? It can be different for everyone but it might be more energy, more resolve, tenacity, optimism, compassion. Basically all the good qualities that are already inside us, but more pronounced. How long do they last? Michael (the OP author) suggests 2-5 days. That might be about right; it differs for each person, each ceremony. I might suggest it can last a little longer, but I won't quibble.

These superpowers give you the little boost of additional strength to power you through obstacles that might have previously seemed intractable. The obstacle might be a creative block, an addiction, a relationship gone awry, a pattern of negative thinking that you just can't seem to break.

Speaking for myself and my own personal story, I would say that I have definitely frittered away some of the lessons that ayahuasca gave me, because I didn't make them habits. I have more work to do.

But I am grateful that I have managed to do a few things right. And it took some serious effort. In hindsight, I resonate with what Michael wrote, because you do indeed have to put those ayahuasca lessons into action; that post-ceremony glow won't last forever.

The few things I did right. Again, ayahuasca gave me a push to get rolling, but I had to keep pedaling to make them last:

* Seriously cut back on alcohol. From a daily drinker to almost none. I still crave it occasionally, but much less than before, especially if I'm having a rough day. But I realize that alcohol only masks problems, and it's not healthy.
* Started meditating regularly. Ayahuasca somehow unlocked my brain so I could meditate, and that got me on a regular practice. The ayahuasca was the push I needed.
* Gave me a sense of action. I had been living too much as a passive victim and ayahuasca gave me a boost and the courage to take charge of my life.

All of these things are interdependent and support each other. Fortunately, these 3 things above (and more) now feel ""normal"" to me because I have put them into disciplined action. Thankfully, ayahuasca broke through the blockages that seemed to make it almost impossible to get these practices started in the first place, for which I'm forever grateful.

Again, great article and I enjoyed reflecting on what you wrote.

You are right though: Trust your intuition.

A retreat might be the best option first up if you don't know friends that have drunk Aya with a good shaman that they can recommend and you can just contact directly. 

Think of it this way: Would you rather work one on one with a good shaman with personalized attention just for you (or just you and a friend and the shaman) or just be one of 10-20 people that the shaman is having to look after?

Sometimes if you are drinking in Peru (I'm not sure where you are drinking) the Shaman can give you Volcanic water to drink the day before the ceremony, and that will make you sit down on the toilet for at least 1/2 a day. 

You drink about 6 cups, 2-3 liters of volcanic water, and then basically pee it out of your butt for 1/2 a day :)

1464,Everything I've learnt from 60+ Ayahuasca ceremonies,MichaelLifeLessons,"Ayahuasca completely changed who I am as a person, and how I perceive others and the world around me.

I'm much more compassionate and energetically sensitive now. 

I don't believe I can change people. Nor do I try to.

I don't believe I know what's best for others either.

I'm very well aware that the way I perceive reality, is not the correct, right, true, or only way to perceive reality, nor is anyone else's. 

I'll sum up my thoughts with one of my favorite quotes:

“Is,"" ""is,"" ""is""—the idiocy of the word haunts me. If it were abolished, human thought might begin to make sense. I don't know what anything ""is"", I only know how it seems to me at this moment.” - Robert Anton Wilson",1,2,ebcdpv6,t3_a45ivu,t1_ebca89a,/r/Ayahuasca/comments/a45ivu/everything_ive_learnt_from_60_ayahuasca_ceremonies/ebcdpv6/

Ayahuasca was another nudge of confirmation that all this is exactly how I dreamt it up to be...a long, long time ago in a place that words can't describe. I am Brahman who got bored and decided to get lost in maya in an infinite number of forms and then see how long it take for each being to Awaken and ascend all beings from the most neglected to the most exalted.

This is nothing unique or special, it's been described in the Vedas and there are all kinds of historical examples. All the masters are saying the same exact thing, once you realize that yourself then only a few scriptures are helpful as daily reminders. It's hard to put into words but there is a ""no-more-learning"" stage described by all the Buddhas who've walked this world. Then it's all about integration, love, action, there is a lot of work to be done on this world and plenty of slack to pick up.

That lead to my posture, my facial expression and my eyes changing a lot over the years. For example, I am going a lot more upright.

I didn't notice changes in regards to my taste of movies or music. I still very much enjoy more intense, but still melodic music, like certain punk rock, metal, electronic music, etc. I still like action movies and action focused video games. So no changes there.

But I noticed other changes in regards to substances that I don't think are of a psychological nature: I can't drink alcohol or coffee anymore. I wasn't a huge alcohol drinker, but I used to love coffee, but after a few years into my process of working with Ayahuasca, my body just can't take them anymore.

I also can't really watch any modern media anymore, nothing violent, loud, or intense. Even acting in general feels kind of conflicting, so much projection of ego and desire for drama. There are a few movies I still enjoy but it's very rare to find something I can sit with, my body physiologically rejects the tv screen most of the time. I get the same thing with my eyes, they start to actually feel pained from absorbing the images. Same goes for video games, I used to be big into pc gaming but my nervous system just isn't into it anymore.

Music has definitely shifted, I used to like heavy metal and whatnot but now it's mostly just ambient and a bit of downtempo. Even the lyrics and intentions of songs can really get to me. 

I've noticed a shift in my connection to colors, lightning, object placement etc. Just general ""vibe"" of my surroundings. I really like things to be organized and intentional whereas I used to be quite scattered. The subtle qualities of a space really matter now, it's like I desire my surroundings to be as intentional as possible.

I have little interest in movies and tv shows. already stopped watching most of the news and general tv before ayahuasca since most of it is pushing someone political agenda usually by creating fear and polarizing people. 

Food pattern has changed for example i hardly eat deep fried foods also tried it but again same as the alcohol did not enjoy it at all. Eat less red meat and nearly never pork.

There is also more space between impulses and action giving  more time to feel if the impulse really deserves the attention it would have previously gotten.  
love being in nature more.

 In the past used to feel a bit uneasy around some young children, completely  Disappeared. has become a quick an natural connection.

I don't seem to fear death or the faith of the world. not that i have negative desires for it it is simply not in my hands anyway and the best change i can make for the world is raising my own level of consciousness rather than worrying about ""the wrongdoing of others""

Ayahuasca showed me a lot of things that seem very simmilair to many of the nonduality teachings around

It rekindling my spiritual path, not religious, but through direct experience. 

had some scartissue on my belly from  medical surgery  just after i was born that was swollen and the scar is barely visible now .There was a weird mole in the same location that looked inflammated but after a couple of ceremonies it just fell off and never came back.

  
Normally i would be sick with fever at least once a year have not been sick in over 2,5 years. i still can get a cold for a couple of days when its the season for it but its only a minor issue never stopped me from working or doing what i want to do. probably kambo that i do a couple of times a year has been offering gret protection from that.

I found my way to Aya and have yet to do it but I absolutely know that I am going to do it.  It’s now my core focus outside of living and being a good parent and alongside and throughout my work.  Even in the acceptance of knowing, that I will be doing it, my mind is shifting in some ways.  

I actually attempted meditation, on my own, yesterday.    If have laughed previously but I figure if I’m going to a retreat where meditation is a part of the process then why wait?  I’m still eating too much, which has replaced other habits and addictions but now I can’t deny I’m aware and I care more than ever.  I feel I’m talking to myself, reaffirming to myself that, I know certain things are not conducive to a healthy and spiritual me.  Aya has touched me before I’ve even touched it.

Ultimately I was void of spirituality.  Recovery has helped me realise I am not so bad emotionally, mentally and physically but spiritually I am warped.  Like there is a massive kink or skew in my spirituality and I need it fixed.

I explained to my partner and my recovery sponsor; it’s like I know when I overreact and I can fix that by at least being aware of it, first and foremost, which I now am.  Same goes for mentally; I’m a little up and down but I’m certainly not off of any radar.  I’m the best person to fix that and it starts with awareness and honesty.  Physically, I know where to basically start with that and it’s with the mind and self love but spiritually; it’s like, if I was to use a metaphor; imagine a leg being dislocated.  You wouldn’t continue to try to walk on it.  So why do I try and walk the path of life without spirituality?  

I need to, at the very least, acknowledge that I don’t know everything and every which way.  That there are other options out there.  Two years ago I’d have balked if anyone suggested I need to address my spirituality.  The best way I learn is by myself and now I know it’s my spirituality and having tried so many times in the recent past to build upon it and in some cases I’m definitely slowly succeeding yet in other cases I’m utterly failing, to connect in any way but I recognise why.  It needs a serious shift and the shift starts in me.  Hence, Aya came along and smacked me in the face.  In my gut.  My heart.  Literally, ironically, through my YouTube addiction.  

I’m even spending less time watching and listening about Aya and am here now taking and making the time read.  I hope my smoking addiction may take a bit of a beating because at present that’s way more advanced than I but even yesterday I found myself challenging how long I could go without and when I did give in, after nearly four hours of feeling ok, I recognised that is much much better than even just a few days ago.

Hence I thank you all for your words and first hand experiences.  I truly appreciated and read every one of them.  Thank you.",1,2,ekafzzt,t3_b6yk1m,t3_b6yk1m,/r/Ayahuasca/comments/b6yk1m/long_term_core_being_changes_from_ayahuasca/ekafzzt/

I've written about this in other posts, but I too feel less pain, in particular in my lower back. For 10 years I had severe low back pain and it went away a few months after ayahuasca.

1578,Incredible. Incredible! Trip report,podconsulting,"I can definitely relate to the crying and praying part.  Prior to my first Aya ceremony, I hadn't cried or prayed in almost a decade.  The second night of the ceremony I experienced my death, rebirth, and transcendence into unity with universal consciousness.  I began to cry tears of joy/sadness and just kept on crying for the next couple of weeks.  It was awesome and such a relief.  Ayahuasca helped me learn how to feel again.  The greatest gift I've ever received.  The gift of being able to step into my birthright as a self-aware conscious being on this beautiful planet we all call home.

1588,My First Ayahausca Experience Yesterday: A Full Breakdown,PeriloAmbrosio,"I had an experience where a lot of eyes started to appear to me when I closed my eyes. 

At that stage of my life I was having a lot of struggle with social anxiety, so when the eyes started to appear and multiply I would get very anxious.

Out of the sudden, Ayahuasca transformed me in ""just another eye"" in the middle of thousands of eyes and lecture me how my social anxiety play tricks within my mind that I needed to be aware of.",1,3,enelkan,t3_boavng,t3_boavng,/r/Ayahuasca/comments/boavng/my_first_ayahausca_experience_yesterday_a_full/enelkan/

What you said about the feminine presence throughout is something that I had in my own Ayahuasca experience, mostly feminine throughout and what you wrote about the mother cradling her baby type love I got that aswell at its peak, like a unconditional love that was very visceral.

1599,My First Ayahausca Experience Yesterday: A Full Breakdown,Xatos1337,"Well I just did it yesterday, and honestly I'm fatigued a bit. I feel great and I'm processing the experience, but it took some juice out of me. I'm wondering if it's because it bonds with serotonin and maybe I'm just a little depleted. But I'm not down or anything, just need another nights sleep I think.

Overall I'm very happy that I did it, and as more time goes on (I had to goto work today, I had things to do after the trip, and I haven't really had time to sit and simply process it all) the more I realize about it and figure out.

After my experience (well basically since yesterday) I started trying to look things up that happened to me, like the Jaguar and the eyes. Turns out it's a strong archetype in Ayahuasca which is mind-blowing, and here you are relating to it the same way. Incredible. 

It's a LOT to consider. The eyes in particular most of all have me the most curious and perplexed. They were definitely spiritual in nature.",0,1,enjyiie,t3_boavng,t1_enhrpms,/r/Ayahuasca/comments/boavng/my_first_ayahausca_experience_yesterday_a_full/enjyiie/
